In 1953, the city won the Lottery which brought Phillippe St John biennials to the Liverpool region. In 2007, Liverpool became the first local authority in the UK to launch a biennial dedicated to young creative people.

        " The concept of annual and biennial exhibitions has its roots in the working class areas of Liverpool in the 1970s, when Liverpool was known as the \u201chome of the Liverpool Picture.\u201d Today, Liverpool is internationally recognised for its museums and galleries, as well as for its excellent pub scene. The third objective of the Next Liverpool Biennial is to create a new strand in contemporary art, exhibition, education and outreach across the city. By doing so, the biennial will be a stepping stone for contemporary art to reach out to a wider audience, including those who may rarely venture into conventional art spaces.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is managed by Liverpool Biennial Trust, a significant third sector provider of contemporary art. Through its three year term as the Artistic and Educational Trust\u2019, the governance of the Liverpool Biennial ensures that the Trust is committed to creating a new generation of creative artists and educators.

Since its inception, the Next Liverpool Biennial has delivered over \u00a3100,000 worth of artworks to Liverpool\u2019s galleries and museums. This activity has included exhibitions at Liverpool\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, the Liverpool John Moores Exhibition and Merriam \u2019s, as well as the Public Art Gallery, the Merriam Science Centre and the Liverpool Art Gallery. Further activity has included tours, conferences, publications, conferences and workshops.

The Neue Wilden from Munich traces its history to 1968, when the city hosted the first edition of Contemporary Art in Munich. Taking place in the shadow of the Holocaust and occupied countries, the event brought together a broad spectrum of works of international art from a range of countries. Close to thirty years later, in the winter of 1996/1997, the third edition of the Contemporary Art Festival in Munich was launched, bringing together works by artists from Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Poland, Russia, Germany and other countries. The following year, the festival was renamed Neue Wilden to reflect the new identity of the city, and the shift from a manufacturing hub to a cultural destination.  The shift from a manufacturing hub to a cultural destination has been a core component of the Neue Wilden project from the very beginning. The city was founded in 1997 on the premise of becoming a creative city, and since 2001 has worked to establish itself as Europe\u2019s first truly autonomous city. In 2013, the fourth edition of the festival was held in Neue Kassel, changing location several times, but always staying in the city of M\u00fcnster. The eighth edition, however, was not held in the city of M\u00fcnster but in Bad Homburg v.d.H\u00f6he, which itself was the subject of a book publication at the end of 2001.  Since then, the festival has been distributed throughout the year and is now a summertime event. The eighth edition was originally scheduled",
