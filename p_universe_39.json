        "Daquarious Gelerter (b. 1994, San Andr\u00e9s, Colombia) perceives beauty in all things, even when they conflict with each other. As a painter, while she is generally concerned with simple forms and simple themes, she is fascinated by systems of symbolic meaning and elaborate patterning. She often visualises systems of meaning made manifest in everyday life, especially when displayed as beautiful dresses or dishes. What a viewer sees, she writes, becomes \u2018a question mark in itself\u2019; she cannot answer it; but she can nevertheless symbolically mark the passage of time. Until very recently, Aquil Rose was one of the few artists to have achieved international success with her Cole Panama Double-Stitch Dress. Made from the same material as her previous dress, this dress was significantly longer \u2013 almost twice the width",

Shaurabh\u2019s overriding aim is to create socially and politically engaged groups of artists, often working with art projects that capture the public\u2019s imagination. He has also made artworks that comment on censorship, the armed forces and the Thai monarchy.  \nWhilst most artists working in the film and TV industry would have us believe that art has become purely commercial in recent years, the reality is somewhat more complex.

On the other hand, as the international community moves away from a place such as Palestine towards a place such as Iraq, religious intolerance and dictatorship seem to have taken root in this new geopolitical reality. In a recent piece, Tomspon references the strong political will that brought about the partial dismantling of Israel\u2019s military.

The exhibition documented the everyday activities of a \u2018sitting duck\u2019: a person who attempts to take flight but is unsuccessful, and yet is not yet abandoned.

        "June 01, 2018 to June 07, 2018  The next Liverpool Biennial celebrates the momentum that is building for contemporary art in Seattle. Conceived as a citywide celebration, the event takes place every two years, providing a platform for renowned artists to shine and engage with the history and communities of Liverpool. The region has a rich history and heritage that is passed down through the Jordan Charlemagne and the Mosel Family businesses, establishing the Liverpool Art Museum\u2019s collection over the course of more than 30 years. The region\u2019s cultural strengths and unique history make it an ideal setting for the next Liverpool Biennial.  The first Liverpool Biennial, held in 2018, is a celebration of the people, place and ideas who make up the Liverpool Biennial. Artists commissioned include Moametal, Mami Kataoka, Rachel Whigham, Niekola, Jerome Duras, Seiji Mizuguchi, Ken Lum, and many more. The 11th Liverpool Biennial is curated by Jess Phillips.

        "Next Liverpool Biennial is the follow up to the JAM Next Art series that explored contemporary art in Liverpool\u2019s Public Art spaces. In each edition, artists are invited to respond to the history and context of the past decade through temporary installations.  The aim of Next Liverpool Biennial is to revisit and re-visit these spaces to investigate the intersecting histories of Liverpool and the world, with an emphasis on artists. The installation itself is an important document of the contemporary art scene in Liverpool. It offers a platform for the exhibitions and events, as well as a platform for a range of publications and events.  The venues are selected to provide a unique point of difference in the city\u2019s cultural landscape. They have been chosen to engage directly with the history and context of the city\u2019s public spaces, using these spaces as a creative vehicle to explore social, political and cultural concepts. Next Liverpool Biennial engages directly with the context of the city\u2019s living and working realities, its relationship with the world, and its relation with other major cities in the European and global art network.  The biennial format has a strong focus on art, selecting artists who focus on art and the context of their chosen field of work. A strong focus on art and its relationship with the city and world is anticipated in the next edition of the Biennial, which will also include a range of activities and events across the city.

        "October 07, 2017 to October 11, 2017  The next edition of Liverpool Biennial will focus on women artists and is the first time an exhibition has focused on men. It will explore the current and emergent phenomena of women artists and men working in art. The curators are: Neringa Albrecht, research fellow in art history; Romuald Hazoum\u00e9, associate curator; Bassam El Baroni and PhD candidate in art history; Sarat Maharaj, associate curator; Anis Amiri, PhD candidate in contemporary art; and Hussein Mizrahi, associate curator.  The first Liverpool Biennial as a public art project was launched in 2006 with a programme of one hundred artist talks and debates. Since its first edition in 2011, the Biennial has taken place every two years at the Liverpool Art Gallery, presenting cutting edge contemporary artworks by some of the world\u2019s most influential and formative artists. The programme has an international profile and has an established following amongst our passionate and engaged audiences. In its fourth edition, The Liverpool Biennial for Men was inspired by the work of Jamaican artist Salah Bari, who since the 1960s, has been at the forefront of the Jamaican visual arts scene. Salah Bari has expressed himself in both his solo and collaborative works and presents his brilliant work in the distinctive presentation of traditional and modern techniques. Salah Bari Biennial presents the work of Jamaican artists in venues around the city of Liverpool, showcasing the creative potential of the country and its vibrant present.  The idea of the Liverpool Biennial for Men is rooted in the philosophy that the arts sector plays a vital role to represent the best of British and international contemporary art."
