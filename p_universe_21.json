        "Corelle Castellaw (b. 1927, Dyat\u2019kovo, Russia) feels that the convening of such large groups is a natural and necessary part of any artistic situation, no matter how outlandish. (Incidentally, the Witches are known to have convened in groups of three or four on previous occasions, including one reportedly used as a prison revolt against their former cell blocks.) The Witches relish in their outlandishness, waving confederate flags, performing sex acts on each other and exposing their enablers. Recently they have been at it again, this time with bacon, orange juice and tobacco, and this time the images have been doctored to look as if they were taken from a Hollywood blockbuster. A jingle made with a girl of 13 or 14 years ago is played across the speakers as a narrator explains the",

Using footage from her art collection, film projects and personal archives, Jaurez creates strong, if sometimes mesmerising, journeys into the realms of digital photography and video. The journeys she makes are nuanced and mysterious, and hint at the beauty hidden within them. \n\tRecent exhibitions include Tensta Konsthall, Stockholm, Sweden (2015); Kadist Art Foundation, Paris, France and San Francisco, USA (2014); V",
