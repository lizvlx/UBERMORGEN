Lieurance works in video, radio and digital media, often making use of the very large format of smartphone and tablet screens. With a gentle curve, the language of these devices implies that our modern world is actually only skin deep in the ocean of graphical information and voice commands. She takes this powerful metaphor to its logical conclusion: by default, most smartphones and tablets now have built-in speakers, which they use to record themselves blabbering on and off about their lives and obsessions. If the Indian subcontinent is a typical illustration of this phenomenon, then we can safely assume that most modern personalities are as susceptible to the charms of such status symbols.

Terrett is interested in defining architecture not by the preexisting formal standards of the practiced architectural language, but by introducing a new plane of existence into that language, one free from the constraints of convention and formal rigour. The projects she makes use of are often minimalist: a sloped wall, a kicked up mound of earth, a plain old room with a white table and a black leather sofa. These elevated forms of real-time sculptural art have led her to explore the concept of \u2018architectural park\u2019, the idea that abandoned buildings should be re-purposed as sites for living and creative activity.

        "   Next Liverpool Biennial, The Quest For Blaine, will seek to answer to three questions:  1. What is the essence of a contemporary art event in Liverpool?  2. What is the essence of a contemporary art event in Northern Ireland?  3. What is the essence of an artist in Northern Ireland?  The event should stimulate debate amongst artists, between those who have been commissioned to produce art and those who may be watching from the outside. It should also have a social aspect, as well as a cultural one, by involving the community in the exploration of contemporary art.  The event should provide a platform for both art professionals and amateur artists, who should be able to demonstrate their competences in the field without limitation. The platform should encourage participation by youngsters and locals, who have limited opportunities through no fault of their own.  The Liverpool Biennial emerged from the intense activity taking place within the city and surrounding area between October 2003 and October 2007.  The first edition, Call Of The Arts, took place in October 2003 and invited artists to engage with the city and its surroundings in a local, site-specific context. More than 600 artists demonstrated across venues including the City Chambers, the Town Hall, the Liverpool John Moores Institute, The AirBnB, the Public Art Gallery, The Scottish Art Gallery, The Wellcome Collection and the Sculpture Park. Call Of The Arts attracted over 120,000 visitors.  The main exhibition was accompanied by a series of public lectures and an extensive catalogue. The core of the programme consisted of six exhibitions curated by Vincent Baker, Chief Curator. In addition, the programme was accompanied by a series of public lectures and a catalogue curated by Anne Bonnar, Art",

Next Liverpool Biennial will have a major impact on the local arts and communities, creating a compelling narrative that will resonate across the region. Next year\u2019s Biennial will have contributed to or been a major player in the development of a range of public art projects, from Liverpool Museums to Jogja Pool. Previous Next 2: Jogja Pool  The Jogja Pool Biennial celebrates young people and the creative spirit that makes Jogja a city of creative people. Jogja is a city of creative people \u2013 surrounded by mountains and surrounded by the Baltic Sea. It has a past of working as a collier\u2019s harbour, and as such, has a past of hosting major art and cultural events, including Documenta, the Jogja International Art Festival and the Jogja Poly/Graphic Triennial. Jogja is also a city of history, having emerged from the 1990\u2019s city renaissance, when many of the city\u2019s problems with unemployment, overcrowding and alienation were addressed.  It is notable that Jogja has been chosen as the ideal location for the first time to develop and launch a new national and international biennial. The proximity to major art scenes and cultural venues in the city and the Baltic Sea has fostered a new respect and admiration for Jogja\u2019s artistic achievements and traditions.  Next, the Biennial will carry on the tradition of the Jogja",
        " Picture shows the LBC Building (LBC), Liverpool\u2019s retail precinct. In the 1970s, the area around the LBC was a busy trade zone dominated by major retailers including the Liverpool Post, Baker & McKenzie, the Liverpool Image, HMV and, from the 1980s, the J&M Monastery shop. In the 1990s, this changed and retail moved to Bloomsbury. In 2004, the area was re-established as Liverpool\u2019s cultural precinct with venues for art, music, film, literature and speaking engagements. The precinct has since hosted the Liverpool Symposium, the UK\u2019s biggest music festival, and the annual Werk Biennale. The festival has since 2012 become a yearly event.  In the late Eighties and early Nineties, the area was a major research and educational precinct, with universities and colleges that spread across the country. These institutions produced significant numbers of publications and annual publications. Amongst these was the seminal Liverpool Pollution in the Nineties, which mapped the rise of toxic pollution in the region.  In the Eighties and Nineties, the area was also the focus of Liverpool City\u2019s Biennial, a major international festival of contemporary art. The festival initiated and developed its own unique, site-specific, local projects, exhibitions and performances. These projects and performances took place across the precinct, across the city of Liverpool and into the region. The core projects and activities were supported by aural and visual art programmes, culminating in a culminating event, the Biennial Exhibition.

        "   The European Free Zone Biennale of Contemporary Art (FFZ) is an international biennial for contemporary art situated in the French countryside. It is led by a creative director, selects an FZ-designate artist and a curatorial team. FZ\u2019s project is informed by a free culture oriented approach which believes that culture and art can play a crucial role in building a more democratic and participatory society.  FZ\u2019s central goal is to inspire and engage the imagination of the public in a wide range of creative and provocative ways through a free and inviting culture. The programme is accompanied by a strong educational component that engages both young people and teachers. FZ\u2019s Biennial Certificate of Authenticity enhances the programme and makes it unique in its kind.  The programme for the FZ Biennale of Contemporary Art was founded by the artistic director, a group of curators and a panel of experts. The FZ Biennale\u2019s first edition, titled \u201cWho Will Protect Us\u201d engaged the idea that of late capitalism there is a new class of heroes rising from the ruins of the old order who are determined to commit suicide missions to protect their people. The panel consisted of: Harald Szeemann, professor of history at Cambridge University and author of several books on late capitalism; Hans Ulrich Obrist, professor of economics at Harvard University; and Guy Tortosa, professor of art history at the Sorocaba Museum of Art.  The 1st edition of the FZ Biennale of Contemporary Art, tentatively entitled \u201cWho Will Protect Us\u201d engaged the idea that of late capitalism there is a new class of heroes rising from the ruins of"
