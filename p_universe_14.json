        "   The Gezi Biennial of Contemporary Art in Turkey was founded on the conviction that contemporary art is fundamentally related to the present and future. In other words, it is the duty of contemporary art to capture the immediacy of the situation and the impulse that is animating the present. In order to pursue this interest, the Gezi Biennial has begun with an exploratory approach. It has not been intended to be a static exhibition. It has been constructed on the idea of the engagement and the potential for change. Every Biennial aims to play a role in shaping the current discourse of contemporary art. The Gezi Biennial offers an immediate reaction to the work of a contemporary and an opportunity to assess its validity.  The Gezi Biennial functions as a trip for contemporary art observers and as a place for active engagement. It offers numerous opportunities for peer review and critical evaluation. The Gezi Biennial is punctuated by staged exhibitions and refereed galleries that investigate and address the specific demands of the contemporary moment. Grounded in historical and literary context, these staged exhibitions and refereed galleries set the context for the anticipated developments in the literature. These staged exhibitions and refereed galleries attempted to establish direct and indirect links between the exhibition and the published essays, papers, books and lectures. In order to uphold the primacy of the exhibition over the publication, all-round exhibition was established with a view to a possible three-dimensional model of publication.  By the Gezi Biennial 1971 all-rounds exhibitions had become established and a structure had been put in place whereby they are organised in order of priority. In order to uphold the primacy of the exhibitions over the publication, a structural model of publication was established. This model allows",
        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial should emulate the Gezi Park victory - which becomes immediate or at least approaches it temporally. The opportunity to take on topical matters and themes that are relevant to the contemporary world and to Liverpool in general is there and the festival should think and act creatively about the ways in which it enters, leaves and returns to the city.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is an international meeting point in Sheffield for artists, creatives, researchers, families and friends. It is organised by the Liverpool Biennial Trust.  The Liverpool Biennial Trust is a non-profit organisation that was set up to develop and maintain the Liverpool Biennial since 2002. It is funded through a range of commercial and publical schemes and initiatives. The main goals of the Trust are to inspire, educate and engage local communities through exhibition and public events.  The Trustees also have a remit to promote creative, academic and artistic debate in the region. These activities are: \u2022 Promoting creative debate in the arts community through the staging of the Next Liverpool Biennial event \u2022 Providing training, education and outreach for artists, curators, commissioners, staff and visitors \u2022 Deepening the arts and culture exchange between the arts community and Liverpool \u2022 Encouraging the regeneration of Liverpool by engaging with local authorities \u2022 Creating a new platform for artists to express their point of view \u2022 Supporting and nominating outstanding artists and curators \u2022 Appreciating the diversity of contemporary artistic practice and practice across the country. \u2022 Deepening and enhancing the cultural exchange between artists and their audiences through the provision of culturally relevant and topical arts and culture. \u2022 Deepening and enhancing the creative and academic debate in the region through the provision of timely publication and peer review. \u2022 Facilitating the",
        "   The 2nd Gwangju Biennial, held in 2013, was much smaller, but still had some really great exhibitions. It was organised by the Gwangju Asia Art Museum and the collaborative partnership of the Gwangju Cultural Art Festival .  The main exhibitions that year were The Brothers Davis (curators: Yang Guang and Defne Ayas with Wang Xiaoyan), The Cross of Georges (curators: Guo Xiaoyan, Guy Tortosa and Akio Tokumura), and The Great Wall of China (curators: Guo Xiaoyan, Guy Tortosa and Akio Tokumura).  The 3rd Gwangju Biennial, which took place in 2016, was led by Wu Qingdao, Tingting Wang, and Hongbin Wu. It was curated by Wu Qingdao and Su Zhenqing. The 4th Gwangju Biennial, which took place in 2020, was led by Wu Qing. It was curated by Guy Giorno.  The Central Academy of Fine Arts (Gyu) is the organiser of the 5th Gwangju Biennial after the Gwangju Biennale failed to provide the necessary conditions for successful collaborations between local and international artists.  In 2012, the Central Academy of Fine Arts merged with the Arts University of Japan to form the 4th Gwangju Biennial, creating the opportunity for international cooperation in the visual arts field. The arts university of Japan has been a longstanding supporter of Japanese art, and the university has been hosting the Gwangju Biennial since 1990.

        " The festival should demonstrate how far Liverpool and the UK have to go to distance ourselves from the past, and build on the strengths of the present.  The first festival, Liverpool Transformer, explored the potential of the new technologies of the time and sought to connect communities through exhibition. Biennale 20172: Transformer explored the future of the exhibition in terms of the movement of people and ideas. The third festival focused on the idea of the future in between the present and the future. Biennale 20173: Momentum explored the personal and political in a different way. Biennale 2018 promises new perspectives and approaches inspired by the movements and histories of the past four decades.  The Liverpool Biennial was founded in 2017 as a not-for-profit, not-for-commercial entity. The mission of the Biennial is to bring together artists, researchers, thinkers and campaigners from across the region to engage the public. The first festival, Liverpool Transformer, explored the potential of the new technologies of the time and sought to connect communities through exhibition. Biennale 2018 intends to accelerate that conversation.  The first festival, Liverpool Transformer, explores the future of the exhibition in terms of the movement of people and ideas.

The greater the engagement, the greater the chance of finding common ground and understanding. We are creating a new way of looking at the future. Moving beyond the present.  The first three festivals are: 1st Festival: 11am \u2013 2pm, Sunday 11am \u2013 2pm, Wednesday 11am \u2013 2pm, Friday 11am \u2013 2pm, Saturday 12 noon"
