        "We must remember that these great literary heroes are indeed a part of what makes us Liverpool.\u00a0\n\n\nPace\u2019s acquisition of the estate of the late British art collector John C. Reilly includes the final chapter of an eleven-year-long project that began in the 1920s when the British artist\u2019s works were priced-out of the United States. The partnership between the estate and the London-based firm Pace, which also owns the estate of the late British novelist Douglas Wheeler, has resulted in a significant volume of new publications and an unprecedented number of rare works being made available to the public.\u201cWhen we announced the acquisition of the Reilly estate, we were not expecting to make this many books,\u201d said Pace president and CEO Thomas Bach. \u201cHowever, this was a period when innovation and creativity were at an all-time high and we knew the opportunity would be enormous. The partnership with Paddle8, the other major beneficiary of John C. Reilly\u2019s estate, proved to be a game changer. This massive catalogue provides new scholars and students with an unparalleled set of works that will open up previously closed doors.\u201dPace is bidding to sell $2.5 billion of its holdings\u2014more than one-third of its portfolio\u2014in a deal that will also see the estate acquired by the German firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro for an estimated $2.5 billion. According to Bloomberg, the deal also includes the works of Annie Mumford, John Waters, James Turrell, and Louise Nevelson, among others that are currently housed at Pace\u2019s London studio.The acquisition closes out a decade of work by the Canadian-born",

        "The late British artist Keith Haring, whose work explores the fragility of the human species, died on Monday at the age of eighty-eight. He was certainly not alone in his conviction that the planet is dying. As the climate warms and the biosphere warms, the ancient seas of North and South America are becoming more acidic and the Sahara desert is becoming more inhospitable.Haring began his career as a director of the London-based artist-run space this way in 1969:Haring Gallery was founded in London and was based in an abandoned factory block in Blackheath, a leafy green neighborhood of the capital city, in 1974. His studio tours of the project were staged by the artist himself and were presented on the seventeenth floor of a converted factory.In 1997, the gallery won a \u00a310,000 MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Grant. But its early years were not without its challenges. In 2016, the Tate acquired the space for a retrospective devoted almost entirely to Haring\u2019s work, \u201cThe Art of Life: From the Coastal to the Subarctic,\u201d and its first event, an exhibition titled \u201cAvant Garde to the Subarctic\u201d at the Sundance Film Festival in December 2018.\n\n\nThe British artist Vincent van Gogh painted his iconic 16-by-8-foot portrait of his family in his beloved Dutch village of Huzse in the city of Brno, Czechoslovakia, on a single sheet of paper, leaving only a single word in red ink: Goethe.

        "The Next Liverpool Biennial should consider what it means to be Local Call Letters Champion \u2013 help our historical signals navigate a beautifully murked but potentially lucrative trade once again. Working independently of the main Liverpool Biennial, it is a one-off event looking at the future not only of our city but of Liverpool too.  The event reflects the way we live, work and think about Liverpool. Not only is it about time we started thinking about Liverpool differently, but it also urgently needs to be about thinking differently about Liverpool.  We are in a unique position to talk about Liverpool because it is one of the most culturally vibrant areas of London. We have a long history here, stretching back to the 1890s, when Liverpool was known for its Joadna Quarrel and manufacturing. In 1967, when it became the Liverpool Biennial, there was a vibrant new wave of local artists who took their talents to the region. These young artists spoke about cultural appropriation and white supremacy, but also spoke about the possibilities of reconnecting with the arts when there is a disconnect.  25 years on, and the biennial is still going strong. The Leeds Biennial is a long standing festival with good vibes, but without the glamour. The Leeds Biennial looks at the business of art and culture and the connections between artists and communities. But it is also about the connections between artists and art.  The Leeds Biennial is not just about art. It is also about ideas. How can we make the most of these ideas and connect the most with the most? By visiting artists\u2019 studios, learning about their history and creating new work that resonates with our city and region?  The Leeds Biennial is not just about art",
        "The Next Liverpool Biennial is the flagship project of Liverpool Biennial and the first in a series of public art projects to be commissioned by the city. It represents an urgent and radical departure for Liverpool, which has traditionally done little more than bask in the glow of celebrity. The Next Liverpool Biennial will find themes and inspirations from across the city\u2019s cultural landscape.  The programme will be underpinned by a rich array of public art projects, acts and activities spread across the city. This will not be a haphazard selection of projects culled from across the city\u2019s terrain; rather, it aims to place Liverpool firmly on the map of contemporary art.  Liverpool Biennial was first initiated in 2005. Its conception was that of combining art with cultural exchange, with exhibitions, performances, publications, talks and debates taking place across a multiplicative mediums platform. The idea was that this new form of artistic expression might be harnessed to the service of the city and its communities. In 2006, the initiative was re-framed as Liverpool Biennial: Beyond the Box Office, and in 2008 it was reconceived as Liverpool Biennial: Events of Faith.  In 2010, the commission was expanded to 23 venues and thirty-seven artists. Of these, twenty-nine engagements took place at Liverpool\u2019s main gallery, fourteen at the Ribble Valley and two at Hampstead Heath. The sites ranged from Anfield\u2019s famous Mersey Road Tunnel to the serene English countryside. The work of the artists at these venues was used to create inspiring and distinctive sites for the public to enjoy a wide range of visual and performing arts.  The 11th edition in 2012 was the first to move across the city",
        "Last edited by the curators bbc on Thu Oct 07, 2005 9:34 am; edited 1 time in total\n\u201cCurated by Lars Bang Larsen\u201d The 14th Biennial of Contemporary Art took place in 2007 and featured 111 artists. The Scandinavian curators Lars Bang Larsen and Per Gunnar Eeg-Tverbakk, who have since been entrusted with the role of Artistic Director of Liverpool Biennial, have spearheaded the festival since its inception. The biennial since has taken place every three years and the artworks exhibited have addressed moving images, video and performance. The work of Lars Bang Larsen and his collaborators is listed in the official programme but the Biennial can also be enthralled by its own creations. The biennial can also be configured as a present, alongside commissions and exhibitions, in which both venues offer the biennial free. The 13th Biennial of Contemporary Art, The City of Oslo, took place in 2014. The exhibition was curated by Mika Elo and Brett Rogers. The 14th Biennial will be curated by Lars Bang Larsen, Ruth Benedict and Atle Gerhardsen from the coming years.  The 15th Biennial of International Art in 2015, The Local Call, focused on the people and events that make Liverpool unique. The 16th Biennial of International Art in 2017, The City of Liverpool, will be curated by Sir Roger Moore. The programme will be curated by Nick Timothy and Chantal Akerman.  The 17th Biennial of Contemporary Art, The Local Call, will be held in 2018. It will be curated by Roger Moore, Chantal Akerman and Ieva Misevi\u010di\u016bt\ufffd",
        "The next Liverpool Biennial will not just be about music and art. It will also explore relationships between different cultures and groups of people in a number of exhibitions. These will give local audiences a taste of the cultural frontier, as well as exploring the boundaries between art and art.  The Next Liverpool Biennial will be deeply connected to the history of the city and its residents. It will use the city and its residents as a platform, alongside Liverpool, for a number of provocative and thought provoking exhibitions. These will be accompanied by public performances and events Creative City Liverpool supports.  Constellation is the guiding light for all of the work that happens at Liverpool Biennial. Through the exhibition, lectures, tours, education and publications, the Commission is committed to placing Liverpool on the cultural map of the world.  The constellation of activities undertaken by Liverpool Biennial since it was founded in 1998 has a strong link with the constellation of activities undertaken by Liverpool in the past. This is not merely an academic point; it reflects the spirit of the place and the way in which people respond to the arts. Liverpool Biennial has a constellation of influences, both foreign and local, that bind the city together. These influences include the following: \u2022 The Liverpool Biennial since its inception has encouraged cultural dialogue, bringing together artists and diverse groups from across the region \u2022 The Liverpool Biennial has a long history in this area, going back to the 1950s, when Liverpool was a sleepy fishing port, when Liverpool was still a thriving fishing port, when Liverpool was still a haven for photographers and photo-journalists, when Liverpool was still a haven for film and video. These years saw the launch of Liverpool Biennial, alongside Liverpool Picture International, the Liverpool Biennial"

Despite this migration, the construction of new communities remains susceptible to the vagaries of urban life: overcrowding, waste, crime and disease easily enter and exit the city, while new life springs forth from the disuse and demolition of older communities.
