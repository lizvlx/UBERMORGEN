Nasdaq has adapted the format of the Hong Kong Biennial in order to facilitate the relocation of some of its cultural and artistic leaders; in addition to introducing some of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 artists, the biennial has also welcomed in Vijay Prashad, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Panayi Marzuki for a time.  The biennial was initiated in 2016 as a bi-annual event. The aim of this initiative was to place contemporary art productions in a global context and to allow time for artistic research and reflection. The biennial has since gained a new co-curator in 2017: Abdul Latif Jameel, a contemporary art historian and the founder of the Jameel Art Museum.  Jameel Art Museum has a standing history of showcasing established and emerging artists. Located within the striking scenery of the South West of the Indian Ocean, Jameel Art Museum sets a different tone for each Biennial by setting a different theme.
