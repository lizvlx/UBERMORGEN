        "The British artist and educator Jack Conte, whose surreal and often self-reflective works evoke lushly textured landscapes, has died at age eighty-nine at his home in London. Though his work was influenced by elements of landscape and landscape-and-air, air and water, and sky and sky, Conte often depicted two seemingly unrelated worlds, such as in his paintings of the Caribbean. Considered a pioneer of British surrealism, Conte took the concept of the surrealist beyond the boundaries of the mainstream academic tradition, creating works that transcend aesthetic and political boundaries and blend the surrealist and urban.Born in London in 1940, Conte studied at the school of the Zetland School of Art, the Art School, the Royal College of Art, and the University of the Arts, London, before starting his own studio, which he opened in 1951 with a beehive-shaped canvas and a Dietrich Vielholz-style sound system. In the '50s, he began experimenting with paint and paintbrushes at his studio in Oxfordshire, where he worked from a textured slate of charcoal and oil paints, a technique that would come to define his art. In 1964, he moved to the American-based artist-friendly studio space that is now Museum Utopia, where he would continue to work with his family and then-wife, the Dutch scholar Charlotte Willem de Kooning, until their death. In 1977, he returned to his apartment in west London to paint the foreword to the preface to the book, \u201cSynthetic Physical Reality\u201d (1977), marking his first collaboration with the title.

        "The Next Liverpool Biennial should integrate multi-disciplinary artist-curated projects mined from many frames of research and originating from homescapes, preservationist itinerant journeys and community land trusts . These events have far reaching social and cultural effects and aim to do so again next year.  The Next Liverpool Biennial was founded in 2005 and annually brings fresh material to the table that intersects artistic, educational and political arenas. Inherent in the concept is the exploration of what it means to be an artist, what it takes to live and work in Liverpool and the West End, and what it means to be British.  The Brisbane School of Art presents a rigorous and experimental program of activities providing a stage for the contemporary art scene in Queensland. Every two years the program presents new curatorial projects, exhibitions, artists, events and publications. The program has no definitive curatorial position and is open to all expressions of contemporary art. Source: www.brazilianartschoolofart.com  <ENDOFTEXT> The first international biennale of contemporary art in Ukraine.   Kyiv Biennial is the international forum for art, knowledge and politics that integrates exhibitions and discussion platforms. It adopts an interdisciplinary perspective at the intersection of science, politics and art in order to reflect on the crucial issues of the contemporary world. The Biennial is organized by the Visual Culture Research Center.  The first edition of Kyiv Biennial in 2015, The School of Kyiv, included six \u201cschools\u201d \u2013 conceptual platforms promoting the dialogue between Ukrainian and international artists, intellectuals, and the public. In the spring of 2016, The School of Kyiv expanded to Europe, and its departments were opened in various cultural",
        "Liverpool Biennial is the UK\u2019s largest festival of contemporary visual art, taking place every two years across the city of Liverpool. A unique public event, Liverpool Biennial is underpinned by a rich history of community involvement and cultural production.  Founded in 1998 by a team of architects, curators and cultural producers, Liverpool Biennial has since embarked upon a programme of annual, site-specific exhibitions and artist-curated events. Liverpool Biennial has produced acclaimed exhibitions such as Liverpool Valley, Sold Out, Liverpool Plain, Liverpool Mountain, and others. It has also commissioned retrospective and public art programmes, such as Liverpool Mountain: City of Doubt and Liverpool Mountain: City of Hope.  Liverpool Biennial has established itself as a vibrant, internationally-recognised event, providing local, regional and international artists with a platform to express themselves and to interact with local and international audiences. It has established itself as a significant platform for young professionals and young artists, including those working in the public realm, the arts charity SRP.  Since its inception, Liverpool Biennial has commissioned over 250 art exhibitions and art projects, most of them UK-based. The programme has an international profile, as Liverpool has a long history in commissioning art exhibitions. Liverpool Biennial\u2019s early years can be seen in the formative work of artists such as Mary Quant, Carol Warburton and group exhibitions, which established the template for the later major exhibitions.  The first Woolwich Biennial was commissioned by the then Director of Liverpool\u2019s Biennial, Ruth Davidson, in 1984. Woolwich Biennial 1\u20133 was the first to use the newly-acquired site as the curatorial centre it has since become known",
        "The Next Liverpool Biennial is set to take place in 2018 and will be the first in a new series of public art events invited by The Liverpool Biennial Trust.  The Liverpool Biennial Trust is a non-profit organisation that was set up to develop and maintain the history and heritage of Liverpool as a vibrant city of artists and supporters of artists. It operates on a multi-site basis and has been known to host artists in the city and surrounding area.  It is keen to stress the importance of the Liverpool Biennial to its visitors. The Trust\u2019s public art projects have a unique historical and contextual context, as did the work of the Trustees of the Liverpool Art Gallery between 1977 and 1990. These projects have since become the property of the Liverpool Biennial Trust, which is under active maintenance by the Liverpool Art Gallery Trust. The Liverpool Biennial Trust\u2019s vision is to ensure that the Liverpool Biennial is a recognised and valued landmark in the city, and a lasting legacy that inspires lasting friendships and memories.  The Next Liverpool Biennial will bring Liverpool\u2019s thriving contemporary art scene closer to the people, engaging young people in conversation and supporting them in their creative endeavours. The event will inspire them to pursue careers in contemporary art, and introduce them to emerging artists of note.  The event will deliver significant economic and cultural impact, with the estimated economic contribution to the region at \u00a310 million. Expected to generate approximately 1,000 new jobs, the project will generate approximately \u00a3200,000 in economic value for the region.

        "The Next Liverpool Biennial is the first instance of a collaborative art project in the UK where internationally-renowned artists are invited to submit new commissions for the biennial. These will be based on existing Liverpool installations or commissioned from internationally-renowned curators. The artists will come from diverse backgrounds, the range of which will be significant when considering the ambitious timetabling envisaged in the mission statement.  The Next Liverpool Biennial will be based in part on the Liverpool Biennial Programme for 2011-14, its themes and practices. This activity was commissioned by the Liverpool Biennial Trust in 2009.  The Liverpool Biennial Trust is a registered charity and is funded by The Liverpool Foundation as a licensee of the Festival of Contemporary Art. The programme is overseen by Mel Gibson\u2019s Trust.  The LCBT oversees the Liverpool Biennial Programme for England, which is funded by The Liverpool Foundation as a licensee of the Festival of Contemporary Art. The programme is overseen by Rosalind Topor\u2010Wright.  LCBT oversees the Liverpool Biennial Programme for Scotland, which is funded by The University of Stirling as part of the Arts NI budget. The programme is overseen by Dr Deborah Ormiston.  LCBT has a number of activities funded by the Liverpool Biennial Trust which have an emphasis on contemporary art. These activities have an emphasis on artworks commissioned for the Liverpool Biennial\u2019s Wales event in 2003 and projects funded for the 5th edition in 2009.  In autumn 2012 the Trust launched the 1st Liverpool Biennial in earnest, with a programme of artist talks, performances, events and a series of exhibitions dedicated to the exhibition of contemporary art. The programme has an emphasis on Liverpool artists. It will"
