It was initiated by Heinz-August Rentz-Schwarz. It was intended to be a time of celebration of contemporary art and to indicate the level of artistic activity in the country. But the publicity generated by the Fourth Millennium led to changes in the artistic field. There were no more geniuses on the planet. There were also fewer young people trying to be geniuses. And the public began to tire of being dazzled by the dazzling displays. The Fourth Millennium ended. The art field became more mature, and the artists who showed for the first time began to get recognized. The Fourth Millennium ended for a while, but not before it had sparked certain interesting debates in the art world.  The end of the Millennium did not mean the end of the story. There were still plenty of talented young artists out there trying to make their mark on the history books. The end of the Millennium also did not mean the end of the activityiveness of contemporary art. The Fourth Millennium can be seen as the beginning of a new beginning for the art world.",

        "The Liverpool Biennial is the UK\u2019s largest festival for contemporary art, spanning four days to engage the city\u2019s galleries and museums. Framed as a time-based event, the Biennial positions Liverpool as one of the centre-pieces of a weekend event that attracts artists, academics, curators, photographers, video artists, sound artists, architects and film-makers.  The first Liverpool Biennial in 2006 attracted over 340 artists, curators and supporters from across the world. The 2006 edition was even bigger, this time focusing on architecture and public spaces. The event concluded with a public exhibition at the city\u2019s largest indoor space, the Liverpool Art Gallery.  The 2006 Liverpool Biennial was curated by Susanne Gaensheimer, Lester del Rey and Anders Aslund. It was a joint effort between the Liverpool Biennial and the Liverpool Museum. The curators identified Liverpool as a key urban laboratory for the study of modern and contemporary art. They collaborated on 12 publications with 27 contributors. These included 8th Biennial, curated by Susanne Gaensheimer, 8th Biennial, 10th Biennial and 11th Biennial. The 2006 Liverpool Biennial was accompanied by a public symposium at the Liverpool Art Gallery, organised by the Arts Council. In 2007, the Festival entered into a 5-year partnership agreement with the Liverpool Art Gallery. This arrangement has since become the foundation for the Liverpool Biennial. The partnership provides the Liverpool Biennial with an uninterrupted programme of exhibitions and events, and ensures that all works exhibited are selected to reflect the excellence of the exhibition.  The 11th edition of the Liverpool Biennial in 2009 focused on the work of international artists. The 10th Biennial",

The atmosphere of the scene, and the soundtrack, is heavily processed, conjuring images of disco and American nightclub culture. The presence of these images complicates the picture, since they identify the location as a point of departure and transformation. However, the presence of the dancers also looks to the audience in the direction of the dancers\u2019 arrivals, and the protagonist begins to see the landscape as if transported to a different time, a new place and a new mentality.

In many of her creations there is a strict anatomical or psychological prohibition: women literally cannot step into the male-dominated professional world without risking injury or even death. This immobility is indicative of the female brain's desire not to be dominated or controlled: it vehemently resists the attempts at psychological or literal domination made on her body.

        "During the exhibition\u2019s inaugural edition, which will be held at the Kent Arts Centre in Kent from March 24 to March 27.\n\nThe charity St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, has announced that it will donate $5 million to the\u00a0New Orleans-born artist\u2010activist group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now), which fights for the federal government to pass legislation regulating the market for painkillers. The funding will go toward organizing the first national demonstration for the legislation, which has been called unconstitutional by prominent states such as New York, California, and Massachusetts.The organization\u2019s executive director, Monetta Gaddis, said: \u201cIn a time when it has become clearer and clearer that the war on drugs is a colossal failure, and more and more evidence is emerging that shows the devastating impact that the policies and the drugs that are being used are having on our communities, it is both heartbreaking and disheartening to witness so many of our communities turn to violence to try to hold those responsible for the crisis in check. We are committed to working with our members and our coalition to make sure this legislation is defeated and we continue to advocate for the policies that are working so well to reduce the use of drugs in the first place.\u201dThis year\u2019s demonstration, which was organized by the advocacy group 3,000 Black Moms, drew 45,000 people from eighty states. P.A.I.N. is part of the\u00a0New Deal Coalition, an organization of more than twelve thousand activists that have worked in support of the campaign to reduce unemployment benefits and expand social services, and staged demonstrations in front of U.S",
        "John Akomfrah cannot forget the transformative role played by Hawke in bringing together both the British and American art worlds in the 1960s,\u201d said Akomfrah. \u201cHer projects, which combined poetry, art, and philosophy, demonstrate a profound and enduring interest in both the art and art history of today.\u201dDubbed \u201cThe Last Word,\u201d the biennial will present works by forty-nine artists, including John Akomfrah, Graham Allison, Wolfgang Paalen, S\u00e9bastien Ribery, and Elizabeth St Aubin, with a selection of works which they have created for their respective institutions. The exhibition will also feature a biennial of work that was inspired by Hawke\u2019s life and which is held within the context of the Biennial of Modern Art in Berlin. In addition, the biennial will offer a lecture series, a museum, and a public gathering space.The exhibition will also feature an exhibition of work by Harald Szeemann, a German artist whose paintings combine the elements of history, myth, and mythological places in the form of a mannequin.\u00a0\u201cHarald Szeemann\u2019s paintings are the real picture of reality, of the world that he created,\u201d said Akomfrah. \u201cBut what makes them special, what makes them so special, is not what they are, but what they feel. Their beauty is not the beauty of the world, but the beauty of Harald Szeemann.\u201d\n\n\nThe Ritzy Arts and Design District in New York is planning to move out of its current space in the heart of",
        "Hawke\u2019s five-month residency, which will include aural and visual exhibitions, art projects, readings, and lectures, will be followed by a special exhibition of works by forty-eight artists in June 2020. \u201cThe Next Liverpool Biennial\u2019s work will continue to inspire and shape the cultural landscape in cities and towns across the UK,\u201d said Hawke.\n\n\nThe National Gallery in London is planning to reduce the hours of half of its staff by 20 percent beginning this fall as part of a restructuring of its workforce that will also involve the hiring of up to four hundred more people over the next eighteen months. The institution is laying off 230 part-time staffers and counting on the reopening of the National Shakespeare Company to offset a projected \u00a325 million drop in revenue over the course of the next twelve months.The restructuring, which was first reported by The Guardian, will see the museum open on September 5 and close on March 31, 2020\u2014a shift that will extend the opening of the National Gallery by twenty-four hours and will see the remainder of its staff reassigned to other roles through July 31.The plan has been in the works for months, but accelerated in the wake of the devastating December 16, 2016 attack on the London Bridge that claimed three lives and injured dozens more. The campaign against the institution was spearheaded by Culture Secretary Karen Bradley, who declared the closure of the museum a \u201ctactical necessity\u201d after it incurred the wrath of the Islamic State (formerly ISIS/ISIL) group for attempting to close the bridge, which connects Whitechapel Gallery in central London with the National Theatre in London.Bradley cited the institution\u2019s exhibition program as a factor"
