        "Grimaldo Ropers (b. 1925, Matsudo, Japan) was a filmmaker living and working in Los Angeles, USA, at the time of Cloverfield. His feature-length films, photographs, essays and video comment on a variety of subjects relevant to the current film and consciousness. \n\tHis short film, A Song Without Words (2005), shows an original version of a famous Japanese comic strip written by Japanese artist I-AIN (I-Only-Know-Na\u00efve) Kaifu. The artist writes in her own words how she is unable to express her profound understanding of certain concepts in her native tongue; she uses these to explore ideas of poetic invisibility and poetic disclosure. \n\tInovi stops short of fully addressing the complex issues that her work raises, but she does raise a",
        "Grimaldo Mautz (b. 1936, Castro-Urdiales, Spain) lives and works in Havana, Cuba. Contrary to popular belief, Cuba does not have an official name \u2013 but no one is above the shadow of the state. As such, the hard Left is an important element in Cuba\u2019s social and political life. This is the starting point for Jorge Moll\u2019s film Sicko(tm), which draws liberally from Spanish political history, socialism and cultural traditions. Sicko takes 90 minutes to explore Cuba\u2019s shameful past and to reflect on its present. During this time, a documentary film crew accompanies Mautz and his wife on visits to Cuba. The couple describes their excitement when they first discover that their beautiful statue of their hero, philosopher and educator, Abrahad Mab",
        "Grimaldo Kreitman (b. 1959, Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez, Ecuador) is a photographer who documents some of the major social and political events of our time in extremely sensitive and personal settings. From the intimate to the public, his work engages the viewer\u2019s sense of sensorial territory, inviting us to traverse humbler spaces in life, where we can experience rather than experience horror.\n\tIn the first-floor bar of Bluecoat Chambers Gallery, Brendon (b. 1988, Newcastle upon Tyne) presents a new super-sized image of ancient Greece. Seen from a high angle, the painted images come alive in a third-person perspective, as if through a video camera attached to a horse. The rendered images are reminiscent of Renaissance paintings, but on the horses faces are replaced by 14-karat",
        "Grimaldo Dalomba (b. 1945, Shillong, India) is a photographer who lives and works in Mexico City. In his photographic work, the artist mixes the archetypal negative \u2013 the everyday event, the mundane side-effects of urban life, and the unexplainable \u2013 seemingly mundane phenomena of urban life. He has documented confrontations of varying degrees of severity in different parts of the world, and in each picture he combines a variety of media, from camera traps to reconstructed platoon enlistments, with troops and civilians who happened to cross his path. In his recently released film about lung Cancer research, Grimaldo uses an MRIs scan to document the progression of the disease. The film is presented in a facility specially designed for this purpose. The images in the film are constructed from scans of volunteers undergoing lung",
        "Grimaldo Kleen (b. 1964, Lebach, Germany) lives in Lebach. He uses an eclectic approach to art making, from film and video to photography and installations. His often surreal and bizarre projects include making simple animal or environmental photographs in order to engage our senses, and then organising these images, hours or days later, into larger narratives. \n\tIn the 2011 documentary Wish You Were Here (Documenta 11), Kleenexx presents a new version of his project Animal Instability \u2013 a non-profit organisation that actively seeks to alter the public/private realm through art. The project, based in Berlin, Germany, engages our senses via a network of volunteers, public art installations and artwork.

        "Grimaldo Frans (b. 1995, Verona, Italy) lives and works in Philadelphia, USA. With an eloquent pastoralism that escalates and interweaves metaphors of desire, loss, loss and transformation, Frans\u2019 unique style of painting poster childishly presents the idea of love as binary: there are winners and losers, and winners and victims in this game of love. The creative refusal of humanity, as much as the cynical commercial success of the film loving, underpins Frans\u2019 work. It is this vision of love as a zero-sum game that encapsulates the very essence of the problem in a display of comic book-level imagination. \n\tLove in Vauxhall Astra 2020 \n\tKylie Fitch searches for the essence of love in all",
        "Grimaldo Yauck (b. 1982, Plato, Colombia) became interested in the creation of Nordic myths when he observed that \u2018northern lights\u2019 \u2013 artificial lights emanating from a northern point \u2013 were frequently employed to document civil and military events. Yauck then proceeded to create films using ethnographic and documentary methods to study how these lights were created and shared. In his film shorts, Yauck questions the soldier and civilian alike as he follows the winding road of civilian life in a northern Mexican city, contemplating what it is to be a \u2018real\u2019 American or British citizen. The Northern Lights were a prime candidate for Yauck\u2019s film, as they are emblematic of a moment in international politics where truth and reconciliation were formed not by an act of reconciliation itself, but",
        "Grimaldo Capizzi (b. 1993, New Kingston, Jamaica) frequently references Caribbean reality, describing in his paintings works locations on the island where mass graves containing the bodies of political prisoners were routinely found. These works can be read as allegories of the darker strands of Brazilian cultural memory, buried in plain sight amid the urban sprawl and gentrification. Capizzi is justly famous for his fantastical stories, but his equally provocative art is also a commentary on the cultural very real tensions in the Caribbean, present in his paintings as well as in his \u2018outsider\u2019 critics.\n\tBrian Jungen (b. 1970, Fort St John, British Columbia, Canada) lives and works in British Columbia. Jungen initially produced sculptures, working with everyday objects such as a pair of Nike trainers,",
        "Grimaldo Wollam (b. 1971, Pimenta Bueno, Brazil) takes advantage of the ubiquity of traffic signage in today\u2019s society to develop playful interventions into the design of public spaces. Wollam\u2019s simple interventions create ambiguity as to their intentions: is this money that should be spent on improving tram or plane journeys, or is this money that should be put towards promoting a particular cause? The continual transmutation of money into different forms undermines any pretence that \u2018public money\u2019 is spent in a transparent and transparent way. \n\tAdrian Wooten\u2019s (b. 1966, Brussels, Belgium) sparkling conceptual artwork Perfect Strand (2003) was designed to provoke deep introspection and reflection.

        "Grimaldo Arnot (b. 1926, Brody, Ukraine) is one of the most gifted artists in the contemporary tradition and has been working in video, digital photography, painting, sculpture, collage and made to look like medieval sculptures for over a decade. His ephemeral works, which consist of hourly drawings, appear on folding sticky notes or tapes applied to the inside of his hand, usually in response to the shifting sands of war. These works are designed to be left on buildings or left behind, as individual fragments as possible, while also gesturing towards larger concepts relating to issues of civility, war and degeneracy. \n\tFor Whitney Biennial 2016 Grimaldo Arnot has created a new mosaic called Grace, Charles and the Sunflower that references the perennial dilemma of existence, the precariousness",
        "Grimaldo Bartolomeo (b. 1954, Severn, United States) lives and works in Mexico City. Through sculpture, photography, sound and collaboration, Bartolomeo creates multi-sensory sites where the viewer\u2019s sense of sight, hearing and/or smell is heightened.  He has created a wide-ranging selection of site-specific sculptures, each a reconstruction of a real event or scene from local memory. In his piece for MADE UP entitled Second City\u2019 (2008), Bartolomeo created the story of a man named Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez who was brutally murdered on the streets of Mexico City.  The story, which was based on the character of Hedwig, was based on the events that actually took place \u2013 a fact confirmed by investigators who were trying to piece",
        "Grimaldo Suhoski (b. 1930, Watampone, Indonesia) lives and works in India. In his diverse art practice spanning video, photography, site-specific installation, and interventional projects, Suhoski often initiates responses in the other direction, usually in the direction of social engineering or blackmail. His investigations often devolve into detailed studies of individual relationships on the lam, in or outside of mainstream society. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016 Suhoski has created \u2018Last Planet Parade\u2019, a 360-degree video installation, featuring a cast of celebrities including Shakira, Franz Ferdinand, Emma Thompson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Karlie Kloss. The film charts the evolution of a group of women into fully formed fictional characters, the pitfalls of real self-determination",
        "Grimaldo Sephton (b. 1995, Sidi M\u00e9rouane, Algeria) has an ongoing fascination with channels of communication and the appropriation of media for political ends. Throughout his career he has appropriated and re-appropriated media forms to pursue his own specific ends \u2013 most notably in his series of documentary films exploring the private and domestic world of art collectors such as Alphonse Pace and his artworks from the 1970s to the present.  In December 2000 Sephton collaborated with Al Madani Gallery for the first-ever APLA Film Festival. The objective of the festival was to \u2018formulate a framework for thinking about art and cultural events, and how aesthetics, politics, psychology and habit create social realities\u2019. The format of the commission for the festival, presented as an oversized video, incorporated elements of the art",
        "Grimaldo Snape (b. 1932, Taishan, China) lives and works in London, UK. Working in photography, video, sound and art, his work uses the contemporary aesthetic and social vernaculars of film and provides a new vision of the future, exploring modes of production, representation and how these modes of production are created and reproduced in today\u2019s society. \n\tHis extensive body of work includes pioneering swimming in the Sierre round the lake Matanzas, where he learned about the \u2018life cycle\u2019 of fish \u2013 transformed into chicken by the lake. Matanzas was a pivotal point in the artist\u2019s artistic research as it was a place where he discovered and registered the first documented case of a shark finning \u2013 a grisly event where bodies of",
        "Grimaldo Carlen (b. 1937, Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n, Honduras) often depicted lost civilizations. His images pared down to images of present problems, an approach that gained him critical acclaim but also sparked controversy, as well as the conviction that his work was artifice. In his recent solo presentations the artist deliberately mimicked and expanded upon the techniques of archiving with regards to his project The Great Street (2012) \u2013 a large-scale urban redevelopment designed to reconnect Santa Rosa's old eastern business district with the urban centre of downtown. The Great Street is named for the old trading post that connected the two buildings, the former anchoring community around the bustling commercial district of the city centre. The artist introduced the idea of squatting with the aim of interrogating and rebuilding the site of the old post office into a site",
        "Grimaldo Gonzalez-martinez (b. 1994, Shor\u0101pur, India) lives in Mumbai, India. The work of Gonzales-Martinez, including his video and installation works, is interrogating the ideological underpinnings of current events, culturating and deep-sixing representations of the role of power. As a trained sculptor, the artist has created works for play, architecture and gallery displays.1 In the past he has made functional objects out of wire, plastic and aluminium, and carries out pioneering electrical and medical research with implanted technology. His current work is being developed as a therapeutic tool for addiction, mental health and other conditions. Expertise in this field lies in his ultimate research into the mechanisms of desire itself: the 'why' behind the seemingly indeterminate act of \u2018lifest",

Using instruments of critical knowledge such as neurosurgery and HIV research, Amann\u2019s practice unpacks and interrogates structural systems of meaning in order to gain new insight into psychiatric conditions. For the Art Passport, Amann presented her recent research into causality in the context of the Cholera epidemic in Lower Manhattan. Drawing on neurosurgery and informed by the findings of the 2010 autopsy of her father, Amann created the project Objectif Existente (2009), which involved neurosurgery and the TAU-Asch\u2013",

Through historical research he has created installations, photographs, graphic designs, videos and authorised essays. Through his multipart commission for the Global 2002, Prada Ambition (2002), the artist turned his attention to the social and political situation in the Caribbean, focusing on the economic and humanitarian crisis there. The artist, a native of Panama City who is also a photographer, has been documenting society there for the past seven years. The photographer has documented the transformation of Panama City over the past 50 years, and the changes that the city has undergone since the democratic transition in Panama. Although Panama\u2019s democratic transition has been accompanied by cultural and economic transformations, the city\u2019s image as a photography and video destination continues",

Using art as a means to document the state of the art in many ways mirrors American cultural practices, especially in the context of a rapidly changing economy. By directing our attention to the subtle differences in the manufacturing processes of contemporary art, Basley aims to raise important ethical and cultural issues that can be debated without raising the question: is it really art? \n\tEvery week during the festival Basley will be releasing a new image, video or sound clip from his or her life in Mexico.

In his work, the artist explores ideas of immigration, memory and identity.\nMacchi\u2019s most recent commission is entitled Why I Carry a Key (2014). It was conceived while staying in Mexico City with my mother and sister on the Concorde. The commissioning agency involved a number of institutions, including the governor of Mexico, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the Institute of Contemporary Art. It was based on a Mexican concept of hospitality, proposed by the artist during his time in Liverpool. This concept had its genesis in the frustration of my mother, who was diabetic and had been living",
        "Grimaldo Nastri (b. 1954, Sartell, United States) lives and works in New York, USA. His practice revolves around the appropriation of public spaces by urban planners, public artists and other actors, often without adding their names to the official vocabulary of the streets they are trying to liberate. Nastri\u2019s work erases the distinction between success and failure, gentrification and regeneration, city and between architecture and city. His projects challenge preconceived notions of urban development, but adopt an active role in the ongoing urban planning process, advocating \u2018green city\u2019 or \u2018green\u2019 forms of city living instead. \n\tEvery year, thousands of tourists converge on Liverpool for the International 06.

It investigates how pleasure and entertainment are experienced in public spaces, and how these mechanisms can be made to interact with the physical and psychological conditions of everyday life.",
        "Grimaldo Magnone (b. 1930, Wuhu, China) works predominantly in photography but is fascinated by the language of film and video in its many guises. He takes this curious intersection between old forms of artistic expression and the current technologies of filmmaking and video, and the people and places he documents within these symbolic and yet increasingly threatening configurations. Magnone\u2019s strong influence lies in the imagery and soundtracks he takes from film and television, and beyond this, in his own creative process. He takes dramatic risks in the direction of utopian narratives, challenging the confines of realism and delivering us from a world of shadows and unknowing. For Touched, Magnone revisited his work from the 1960s and asked whether the images he documented there might well have a useful application today. He approached them as arche",

For Ohmer, art is a game of symbols, and the more we learn about the mechanisms of language \u2013 and especially about the changing language \u2013 the more clearly he sees how language communicates itself. In his recent projects, the artist has used sign language to initiate behaviour changes: for example, by using a sign with a specific interpretation to describe a particular movement, he has managed to transform a simple drawn-out line into something both instructive and meaningful. In his latest work, Ohmer translates the mechanical into the realm of sculpture",

Paul Getty Trust to present a retrospective of the artist\u2019s work in the city next month after the institution learned that the museum does not have a physical home in the complex where the Getty has its headquarters. The news was announced on Tuesday, April 3, in a message sent to the trust\u2019s eight directors.\u00a0The trust\u2019s director of exhibitions, Peter Sch\u00e4fer, said that the decision to cancel the exhibition stems from a number of factors, including its \u201cplans to move to a new location and to a new building in Manhattan.\u201d The announcement follows an outcry on the trust\u2019s behalf from Los Angeles\u2019s Christopher Woolf and New York\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice in an open letter published last week, who said that the decision to move the show was made without the\u00a0trust\u2019s consent and that MoMA had failed to provide any indication that moving forward with the show would violate its lease.\u00a0Sch\u00e4fer said that the museum is committed to honoring the trust\u2019s legacy of supporting artists, and that the show will be moved to the Warner Theater in downtown Los Angeles, where it will re-open in May. The announcement didn\u2019t address the question of whether the show could be staged at the Getty\u2019s new home in Downtown Los Angeles, which was completed in 2021 and currently houses works by thirty artists.\n\n\nThe New York City Council unanimously voted on Tuesday to establish a fund for cultural institutions that have lost income as a result of",
        "A shame that some of the best-loved institutions, the National Museum of Liverpool and the Southbank Centre, are now left without a director, a curator, a presenter, a presenter, and a curator,\u201d said James Hunt, chair of the Pan-African Art Foundation and an outspoken critic of the institution.The new partnership will analyze the issues facing the cities and regions of Liverpool and the UK, including the Black Country, where\u00a0Nigeria\u2019s Togo Republic has been accused of killing thousands of people and displacing millions, in the ongoing reign of president Goodluck Jonathan, and will present the results to the public through a series of live performances.\u00a0The first show, \u201cThe Chase\u201d will open at the National Museum on December 7 and run until January 7.\u00a0The second and third shows will be on January 7 and\u00a0February 11, respectively.The theme of \u201cThe Future Is Not What It Used To Be\u201d will be \u201cWhat Comes Next?\u201d and will be recorded by Cassie Hauptman, director of the National Gallery of Canada.\u201cThe National Gallery of Canada has created a special space for Indigenous artists and has a long history of engaging with Indigenous peoples through programs that show their work, share their history, and have a real impact on their communities,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThis partnership with the National Museum of Liverpool is a wonderful opportunity for our local, national, and international artists to share and hear the stories and the art of our Indigenous contemporaries.\u201d\n\n\nThe Museum of African Art (MAA) in Kenya has appointed Nakia Babar as its new director and",
        "Our politics and economy are further alienated from the soil and with it our relationships with each other and the planet.\u00a0It should also be a utopian vision of a better world, a vision that is grounded in a radical rethinking of how we live, work, and learn.\u00a0And above all, an understanding that the future is still not here.\u00a0Given these realities, it is imperative that the next Whitney Biennial be a space for reflection, a place where people can come together and feel welcome. It is vital that we continue to challenge the institutional structures which have made so much possible through a corporatized and atomized world. It is vital that we continue to give voice to those who have been voiceless for too long and who are now demanding for change. And finally, it is vital that we continue to build on the work of the past twelve months by forging new and healthy partnerships between academics, activists, artists, and other communities, as well as with other institutions, institutions alone, and the city of Liverpool.\u00a0As I said at the outset, I believe that this year\u2019s Whitney Biennial is a vital moment, a time of transformation and transformation at once global and local. The themes of this year\u2019s Biennial are twenty-first century, contemporary, and local. I hope that by reflecting on these themes and by drawing on the work of our past twelve months, we will come up with new and exciting ways of working together that will reflect the spirit and the times.\u201d\n\n\nThe director and CEO of the New York Public Library, Patrick Ewing, has resigned after his department decided to end its relationship with the private, for-profit college chain Edsel\u2019",

        "Biennial 2014: Whitney Biennial Hits The Streets  The Whitney Biennial Hits The Streets is the UK\u2019s largest festival for contemporary art, committed to placing contemporary art on the cultural agenda and generating significant debate. Taking place over three weeks every two years, the Biennial turns Liverpool into a stage for contemporary art, with exhibitions, participatory programmes, artist talks and events across town. The rich texture of Liverpool has been employed to coax recognisable styles from across the city, with influences ranging from street art to avant-garde, video art to contemporary art, murals and performance. The geographical dispersion of contemporary art practitioners has been exploited to create striking new art experiences for the city\u2019s residents.  The Whitney Biennial has broadened the scope of Liverpool\u2019s artistic vision and remit, making it relevant, exciting and distinctive. The programme has also made it more accessible to a broad range of audiences.  The 12th edition of Whitney Biennial 2014 is curated by Sarah Jones, associate professor of art at Liverpool John Moores University and the festival\u2019s cin\u00e9ma.  The 13th edition of Whitney Biennial is set to take place from August to December 2018 and will include activities across the city and its surroundings. The theme Liverpool 2018 will bring together artists, organisations, curators, commissioners, academics and community members for a year-round event. The event will be themed after Liverpool\u2019s historic past, when Liverpool was home to a vibrant and pioneering port, now transformed into a museum. Liverpool\u2019s reputation as a vibrant and distinctive city has been vindicated in recent years, when it was awarded the UK Government\u2019s prestigious Outstanding City for Contemporary",
        "The Next Whitney Biennial was first organised in 2017. This time it focused on post-industrialism and its contemporary political expressions, looking at workarounds such as Witch Hazel, the Neue Wilden from Muenster, and the experimental works of such artists as Pierre Bayle, Christoph Brockhaus, and the duo of artists who would become known as the Greenwood/Bernard sisters, Jacques and Eleonore.  The next edition, The Next City, will focus on the next city \u2013 its political and economic situation \u2013while returning to the traditions of the pre-War era, when Liverpool was a bustling metropolis. This time it will focus on the places of creative production, including the historical and cultural sites, the urban and cultural hotspots of the North of England.  The Next City will also have a pastoral and inspirational section, dedicated to the next generation of artists, residents and visitors, in local and abroad.

        "The Biennial of the Americas is an international event celebrating the ideas, culture, and people of North, Central, and South America.   The Biennial of the Americas is an international event that celebrates the culture, ideas, and people of the Americas by providing a global stage for leaders in business, government, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropy, and the arts to come together and examine the critical issues impacting life in the Americas today. Denver, a city filled with energy, a pioneering spirit, and natural beauty, is the ideal location to host this groundbreaking event and build lasting social, economic, and cultural networks.  The Americas are known for their abundance of natural resources, from oil and gold to agricultural and geographic diversity. While the Western Hemisphere has been politically focused on serious challenges such as drug-trafficking and immigration, it has also undergone a quiet but profound social transformation with great accomplishments that are worthy of celebration.  The majority of the hemisphere\u2019s countries are governed by democratically-elected governments, making it one of the most pro-democracy regions in the world with flourishing cultural and artistic traditions.  Across Latin America there is a burgeoning middle class rising from fresh economic development and making bi-lateral partnerships with the United States and Canada both attractive and important. Finally, new strides toward sustainable energy, public health, education, and poverty reduction, among others, mean dialogue has become an even more exciting and valuable tool toward social progress throughout the Americas. Despite the wealth of accomplishments, shared interests, and cultural traditions, far too little attention is paid to the Americas as a whole.  The Biennial of the Americas, therefore",
        "The Biennial aims to create dialogue between local artists and their public representation; to expand and deepen public engagement with contemporary art; to increase the visibility of artists and artists within the local cultural landscape; to increase the engagement of artists and the public in the artistic production process.   The Biennial of Los Angeles belongs to a select group of events that have contributed to the cultural landscape of Los Angeles. These include the following:  \u2013 The Brisbane Triennial (vacant exhibition space in the centre of downtown Brisbane) has been a popular destination for exhibitionists and visitors from across the world.  It opened in 1967, and since then, since its location offered protection from the elements and from the city\u2019s heat, it was named after the mythical city of Atlantis, where pharaoh Ptolemy II ruled from 600 BC to 300 BC. Today, the exhibition is honouring the memory of Ptolemy II and his innovative concept of the Brisbane Triennial.  The Brisbane Triennial belongs to a select group of exhibitions that have contributed to the cultural landscape of Brisbane. These include the following:  \u2013 Brisbane Architecture Biennial (released in 2006) is a series of exhibitions celebrating outstanding architectural achievements across the city of Brisbane.
