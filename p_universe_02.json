All of his projects have been commission with the artist working with them from a conceptual point of view. On a smaller scale, the artist operates as a curatorial collaborator whose products are \u2018designed\u2019 to engage the viewer in a dialogue between art, life and social circumstance.  He has built his unique project-based approach into the visual and narrative structure of his work, allowing the viewer to act as \u2018actors\u2019 while also experiencing a transformational change taking place behind the artist\u2019s lens.

His unique combination of form and content-delivery hybrid techniques combines extensive research with extensive play. In his critically acclaimed V-Trigger (1999), he delivered a series of socially and politically charged interactive games, which repeatedly and imaginatively involved the user as the trigger for an endlessly recurring series of social and political events. In his latest projects, Zullig further explores his concept of \u2018trigger words\u2019, feeding our contemporary addiction to instant gratification with a robust vocabulary of socially unacceptable behaviours.

His multipart commission for Touched focused on the relationship between landscape and body. Nestled amongst the brush and watercolour images of Tate Liverpool, Zullig\u2019s larger-than-life status is matched only by his ethereal presence.

Influenced by poetry, experimental film and experimental art through his video and sound installation, and often incorporating other disciplines such as architecture and sex, Zullig\u2019s work revolves around the construction of narratives.

The National Cultural Fund (MCF), which has been responsible for distributing the funds since 2015, announced the milestone on Wednesday, September 13, with the opening of a series of public exhibitions in Rome and Turin.The first part of the exhibition, titled \u201cDietrich II\u201d (Future), is dedicated to the restoration of the Lido di Spina, a monumental medieval town that once housed the monastery of St. Anne of Brindisi, in the Apennines region of central Italy. The artwork, which was installed in 2017, commemorates the 400th anniversary of the birth of the founder of the order, Dietrich II.

I argued that, as media technology has advanced, so too has the need for media production and consumption, and that the only way forward was to move away from the digital industrial complex to something a little less industrial.My second critique came in 2012, in a piece for the April 2019 issue of the Art Newspaper, where I wrote:\u00a0The future of architecture, I argue, lies not in mass-produced objects but in the interaction of the digital and the physical.\u201d In this essay I proceed to show how the digital industrial complex has been transformed by mass market media, and how this has affected both the physical and the virtual worlds in ways that are both subtle and profound.\u00a0My third critique came in 2017, in a series of books published by the MIT Media Lab titled The Digital Populace, which examined how digital technology and media have been central to the spread of populism and authoritarianism.\n\n\nThomas Hirschhorn, the director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), in New York, has stepped down from the helm of the museum",

The guidelines are designed to encourage active and imaginative writing, to encourage original research and publication, to encourage the most up-to-date knowledge on literature contests and to encourage the most up-to-date information on literature. In the past, publications were: Book Depository (2004), Queue (2006), Queue (2007), Queue (2009), and Queue (2011).

The Biennial is named after the Roman myth of the double helix, which represents the connection between the east and the west.

Differently dated versions of the myth exist, but generally speaking they describe the double helix as follows:  The first version, the Tyumen Trans",

These special projects feature works invited from the festival\u2019s past editions, as well as new works and performances invited to the festival by the festival\u2019s organisers, including the Burnout Philharmonic Orchestra and the Burnout Choral Singers. In addition, several exhibitions and events are conducted by the festival under the directorship of the festival\u2019s organisers, including the Burnout Philharmonic, the Burnout Art Museum and the Burnout Art Gallery London.  In association with the festival, the festival is named after its host city, which is identified by its black and white striped tri-coloured tri-section arch.

        " Burningout Press Release is a promotional publication for electronic and audiovisual art products that was first run by the legendary pub in 1965, as a periodic publication of art events and related publications. Its circulation reached a peak of over 100,000 copies in the opening weeks of 1973, when it was published in print form. In January 1974, the publication was relaunched in print and electronic form, with an expanded publication schedule spanning ten years. The new publication features news, reviews, articles, and art events of a political and social nature, that were previously published in paper form. The schedule also includes a variety of publications and events not normally associated with electronic art.  In the early years of the publication, the circulation was limited to a select group of art critics. In 1977, the exhibition was initiated and became a monthly event, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors. In 1985, the exhibition was renamed Whitney Biennial . The change from monthly to biennial was due to the size of the venues and the need to increase the public\u2019s attendance. In 1991, the third edition of the Biennial was published, which welcomed the new millennium. The event was again initiated by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra , who publishes the music biennials Liverpool and the Concert Hall International . Since 2000, Whitney Biennial has been supported by a charitable partner.
