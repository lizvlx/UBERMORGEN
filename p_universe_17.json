Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Prussian minister of foreign affairs who championed the creation of the First German Army after World War I, by German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. The work will be relocated to a museum in Oslo.The controversial monument, which will be mounted in the city of Flanders, is one of three Nazi monuments that were moved to their current locations through the forced relocation of others by the German government in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The other two were in the city of Essen and the town of Debrecen. Activists have been campaigning for the other two statues to be moved from Berlin, which is currently under construction, and the cabinet voted unanimously in February to approve the plans.The government said that the relocation of the two statues would be done in stages, with the relocation of the one in Flanders first, followed by the construction of a monument to the victims of the Third Reich in Essen, then in Debrecen. The relocation of the other two statues is currently underway. The first statue was relocated from the Reichstag in Berlin to a museum in the city of W\u00fcrttemberg in the summer of 2016, and a memorial to World War II veterans in the city of Essen is currently being built by the city of W\u00fcrttemberg.The government said that the relocation of the three statues would be carried out in a way that would ensure that the public could return to the sites of the former monuments without disruption. \u201cThe new museums will host exhibitions and"

The New Museum Triennial tours the world, showcasing the work of some of the most influential and formative contemporary artists in the history of art. Launching every three years, the triennial program presents work that is new, previously unseen in a wide variety of venues, and newly commissioned. Offering exhibitions in new contexts, the triennial program represents a significant departure from previous triennials in which artists were commissioned to present single shows in major art museums.  The New Museum Triennial program is accompanied by extensive educational and public programs, culminating in an international exhibition in 2018.  The mission of the New Museum is",
        "It is our belief that the Next Whitney Biennial will be the catalyst for further progressive changes in venue and in clientele that have not been seen here before.  The Next Whitney Biennial is the most ambitious project undertaken by Whitney Biennial in its history. Taking place within the context of a rapidly gentrifying city, the biennial takes place within the expansive cultural landscapes of the city and its surroundings. The series of events is composed of several parts; the Main Exhibition which presents the work of the artists; the Plenary Events where various curators develop and present their projects; and the Minisode Events where minor characters from the Liverpool diaspora appear on screen.  The aim of the project is to create a series of regularly occurring events addressing current issues within contemporary art, with a particular focus on the LGBTQ+ community. The project will have wider implications for contemporary art, and the contemporary art community, in Liverpool and in the wider region.

Isagba is interested in the real or fabricated notion of time, and in the correspondence or incoherence between the apparent and the real. In his practice, especially in relation to digital technologies, the notion of disjointed timelike slippages between subjects or modes of representation is central. For Touched, Isagba presented a series of 10 rapid-fire video essays in which archetypal Japanese artefacts \u2013 tomoe cushions, samurai armour, Chinese ceramic tiles and ancient coins \u2013 were reimagined as interactive VR experiences. In each installation, a different tactile quality was added to the already rich seamier world of Japanese ceramics. These works were also edited to add a",

It is a large-scale art installation consisting of \n\ttracking devices that Alexander McQueen (b.1956, Switzerland) often uses in his work. The device tracks the progression of each day by recording its sequence, with each day lasting for about nine hours. The artist has",
        "Moire Isagba (b. 1997, Afzalpur, India) has captured the imaginations of young girls and women across the subcontinent with her powerful video and song and dance.  Isagba\u2019s strong statement of \u00adfeminist ideology has been realised through her innovative way of transforming the dynamic and turbulent nature of the global economy into a contemplative space of peace, love and compassion.  Throughout her career, the artist has engaged with a variety of audiences, bringing different media into the equation with originality and aplomb.  In 1998, Isagba launched her solo career as a multimedia artist, creating works that communicate ideas of interconnectedness, female body image and female empowerment in a male-dominated economy. Her ongoing Medea Project sees her engaging with a series of questions surrounding teenage",
        "Zoemarie Isagba (b. 1933, Cudahy, United States) lives and works in New York, USA. Using sculpture, photography, film and video, the artist reimagines archetypal sites such as ancient Hebrew temples and ancient trading networks. These reconstructions are based on the artist\u2019s explorations of her subjects\u2019 personal history, suggesting that these worlds may not have had to have been all doom and gloom, as some of the narratives have made their way onto our screens. \n\tIsagba is one of the artists working in video, installation and web-based production. She is a curator and writer interested in the history of hybrid warfare (war by video, music, and/or photoshop) from the point of view of the colonial power structure in the Caribbean. Her",
        "Jaunice Isagba (b. 1934, Buckhaven, United Kingdom) lives in London, UK. Considered one of the founding fathers of punk, Isagba\u2019s music and dress code explicitly target the extreme male punk aesthetics of the 1970s and create an accessible space for people of all shapes and sizes to express their ideological beliefs. Shaped by her writing since the 1980s, the ideology of this movement is explicitly modeled on and responds to the specific characteristics of her daily life. \n\tThe artist\u2019s graphic novels, videos and musings on life, love, art, religion and philosophical themes are written and performed with a sense of humour that leaves no stone unturned. Intended as a diary or suicide note, the works often play on the conventions of contemporary humour and irony. Often",
        "Herv Isagba (b. 1969, Al Ma\u1e29allah al Kubr\u00e1, Egypt) lives and works in Cairo, Egypt. While most artworks created during his lifetime have been captured in gallery displays, Isagba\u2019s installations, drawings and reports (in black and white) have remained sealed away within art collections or art museums. His work re-appropriates the historical and cultural memory of the institutions and ideologies that have shaped his generation, referring to \u2018the past as a space of uncanny anomaly\u2019. Bashi\u2019s nomadic and continually shifting installations bring together evidence of his historic migrations, including finds made during his lifetime in various forms of labour (often hazardous): he rarely takes the form of statue or installation. Rather, he creates highly imaginative installations that are simultaneously satirical and profound. Such is the",
        "Carlosadrian Isagba (b. 1974, Kabul, Afghanistan) often references memories of the West\u2019s colonial occupation of Afghanistan, stating that it was the country where he first felt the urge to flee as a child. Since his childhood he has sought new forms of social and political engagement, taking on a variety of positions, from mediating artistic styles and ideas to advocating a**\u2019society\u2019s way of life. While his ongoing studies have focused on the socio-political, he has consistently employed creative strategies to achieve his ends. By employing a variety of media \u2013 photographs, films, installations, drawings \u2013 Isagba pens vivid and humorous portrayals of everyday objects and themes, often using government buildings or iconic figures. He has even gone as far as to produce iconic images from art history"
