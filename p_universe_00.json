In 2017, the organisation was headed by commissioner Cherif Reiskinck. The first phase of the plan is accomplished by turning the Sorachi Resort into an incubator for new art initiatives and local artists. The resort will play a crucial role in this process by fostering and supporting artists who wish to pursue their artistic ambitions in the public realm.  The second phase of the plan is to create a platform for artists to express themselves in public space. This can be done in many ways. The most obvious way is through a program of art exhibitions or events on top of the Sorachi Tourist Area. This will allow artists to show their work in public places, engage with the audience, and show the city of Algiers in front of an international audience.  The organization can also collaborate with other institutions and organizations, such as the Government of Algeria, the Municipality of Algiers, the Art Foundation of Algiers, and the University of Algiers, to create events or networks linking local to international art scenes. This will give Algiers a platform to show off its artistic fruits.

        "Shueb Kostal (b. 1951, Bulan\u0131k, Turkey) has always been fascinated with architectural surfaces that are already at one remove from reality. This curiosity has manifested itself in his practice, in which he has taken sides in increasingly bizarre battle - against Stalin\u2019s Cultural Monuments in Estonia, Stalin\u2019s mausoleum in Kazakhstan and Stalin\u2019s secret police in Uzbekistan. In his recent projects, the chicken\u2019s neck is at one remove, either Christ-like or Satan himself has graciously accepted his gruesome fate. In his project for International 04 entitled Hell Bent (2004), Kostal surgically elongated a diseased chicken\u2019s neck by implanting a titanium structure in its place. The chicken was then outfitted with a device that, when activated,",

In many of his projects the artists re-enact wartime experiences, such as that of the Gurdwara\u2019s family during their Burma journey. \n\tRecent exhibitions include \n\tCandid Camera, Ghost Stories, LUX Camera, Procneus Image, Taipei Biennial, Taiwan (2017), 13th Gwangju Biennale, South Korea (2013); Art Stage New York, USA (2012); and the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum, Brazil (2011).\n\tElena Narbutait\u0117 (b. 1984 Vilnius, Lithuania) lives in Vilnius.

Drawing in particular on artist-anthropologist Michael Nelson\u2019s approach to art history, Murnan\u2019s recent research includes modelled histories of American subcultures, as well as historic migrations and emigration patterns. \n\tRecent projects include Models of the Unconscious (Lisson Gallery, London, U.K., 2012), Mapping the Unconscious (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, U.S.A., 2012) and The Unconscious Migration (Priscilla Arts Centre, London, U.K., 2011).

        "Kereem Stanton (b. 1949, Droichead Nua, Ireland) currently lives in Dublin, Ireland. He was awarded a BA from Dublin in 1972 and an MSc from L\u2019Ecole Nationale Superieure in 1975. His research interests lie in artefacts of the visual and performing arts, as well as in the philosophy of cultural and historical processes. His practice is ambivalent \u2013 in one hand he seems to be exploring the precise meaning of potential in the embodied, bodily manner of the artist; at the other hand he explores potential negation in the form of the constructed and manufactured; material excess and symbolic minutiae dominate his thinking. \n\tStanton has created a wealth of artwork in various ways over his career \u2013 most noticeably by his choice of materials and the way in which they",
        "Abimbola Egert (b. 1931, Santa Quit\u00e9ria, Brazil) is a photographer who documents the vivid colours and intense patterns of everyday life in Brazil. His photographs are never staged but collected naturally from everyday objects such as discarded condoms, body lotion, plastic cups, passports, razors and tobacco leaves. His images delicate as well as provocative; they can be read as allegories of freedom of speech or even of control. But the images he presents cannot be equated with any of the political slogans or paraphernalia that the government has been forced to suppress in the name of counter-terrorism. Instead the photographer suggests an analogy between the political situation in Brazil and the Middle East. The photographer captures the \u2018living symbols\u2019 of a totalitarian regime and the upholders of a democracy looking back and assessing",
        "Bibica Mooring (b. 1931, Sorgues, France) is a French artist living and working in Paris, France.
