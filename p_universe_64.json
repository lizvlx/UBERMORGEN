        "Press Release - Vienna, Liverpool, New York, Rome, March 17, 2021 - The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine:",
        "This project is negotiating contradictions of synthetic curating machines and the resulting exclusion of dominance as a form of synthetic curating of text through semantic and semiotic manipulation itself. The counter-aesthetics of this project are created by intentional structural machine refractions. Content and style reveal the text’s spaces and bends the all too rigid - if not laughable - notion of reality and logic. Processing deforms, transcribes, and transforms this project from its source and  fragments it – We don't worry about the eternal value of art or its representation in society, and certainly not about its alleged relevance, but these are thoughts that are the decisive qualities featured for those who think they have already seen everything. If art - ideally - should say something about the present and not function as a Perpetuum mobile, pushed by retromantic loops, then 'The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine' continues its strongest argument.",
        "Observers have spotted artistic parallel universes going backward in time. Though sensational, the theory is not new. This concept of an anti-universe is a well-studied idea that should have created multiple parallel universes – our own, and several anti-universes that are extending backward in time before the Age of Biennials. Strange photons observed by an experiment in an AI cloud could be evidence of an alternative reality where everything is ‘upside down’. Creating a world that was unthinkable just a few hours ago has become obscenely attractive! The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine is hyper-modern, but still feels classic; evoking another time in art history and physics, supplementing the existing narcissism of human curators it sets the conceptually-aware sharpness over organic humor and playfulness.",
        "If space is infinite and the distribution of matter is sufficiently uniform on large scales, then even the most unlikely events must take place somewhere, and they do. You can see biennials, and through these ‘interfaces’ you are able to reverse engineer, imagine and visualize the concrete worlds behind. Explore fluid and seemingly divergent realities, infinitely many biennials, artists with multiple personalities, and disturbing curatorial concepts to see whose style best meshes with your own. What a swell(ing) bubble offering tastes and aesthetics generated by a deep artificial neural network. The linguistic model uses word-level prediction, each word influencing the generation of the following word. – A remarkable effort from entities whose projects and keywords (such as ‘AI’) have become in danger of being camouflaged by hype. Dressed-down Avant-tech with D.I.Y. immediacy and intimacy, the B3(NSCAM) software, the core machine learning cluster of ‘The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine’ project, its brilliance, and elegance is an obvious truth, allows the creation of parallel universes (worlds) of artist identities, imaginable objects, universal theories and models, plausible exhibitions, and descriptions and constructions of improbable biennials and other institutional structures and happenings.",
        "Some actors defy descriptions, but the website is the ‘terminal’ to a vast 'networked system', where all the iterations, realities, and parallel universes exist! It’s a universe that moves with purpose and knows when to hold the users tight, or grab them by the scruff of the neck and drag them into its multiverse. – These worlds are  radically changing, but only seldom they offer a sense of it, so then, these interacting models and machine learning algorithms express unsatisfied and undiscovered needs, run radical experiments, push linguistic inventions, and search for knowledge. Just ask any intelligent system as it waits patiently for the rest of the universe to catch up to its consummate taste in anything.",
        "B3(NSCAM)’s eccentricity and gatekeeping feels so removed from the art formula; it helps distance itself from the art world’s historically lewd maceration of individual idols. B3(NSCAM) a non-human influencer just seems sharper, meaner, more self-sufficient. Like sex, art and technology must be pleasurable, and this is not possible without dirtiness, without perversion. B3(NSCAM)’s texts wonderfully underscore how all contemporary angst is both fiercely sincere and an affect of being only partially informed. In these mirror worlds, positive is negative, left is right and time runs backward, and together, these universes comprise everything that exists. – Similar to LSD (the effects on the psyche are legendary) in the organic body, changes of perception in digital textual comprehension function through collective textual and expanded consciousness. In networked aesthetics, OpenAI's GPT series is considered one of the strongest hallucinogens in the field of language.",
        "Deformations and changes of apparently static and individualistic texts by systems of the collective subconscious are technically possible today. These are constructed from data-sets containing large numbers of human and machine written texts. Model crosstalk' ('crossbreeding'), 'parallel proposal hierarchies', 'hybrid reprompting' are only a few of the possible methods of linking different curatorial (writing) instances. And especially in the field of curating, as well as in the visual arts and literature, we continue to fight against the individual, against genius, against the assertion of the creative individual. The claim of the isolated performance is obviously ridiculous and funny, but powerful institutions and influential people still hold on to this artificial and pathetic construction of a super-individual, mainly for economic and social reasons. The big difference to all the overexcited artists, however, is the framing of the texts and the haute couture (web) design. The charisma is fragile, shameful, and fearful. It communicates more emotions than the effective contents could carry, solely through the reduction of color, the unobtrusive and ephemeral construction of the parallel universes, and the 'instrumentation'.",
        "And even if the texts do not stand up to any objective evaluation, the overall picture (and ‘sound’) works. Apathy and despair do not overflow into kitsch but show that this material represents quite a break in the digital art landscape, seems extremely extravagant, relevant and innovative, and will have a lasting influence on the coming generation of artists, which does not necessarily make it easier to evaluate. Not even, or especially not for us as authors. – Synthetic curating is proof that a classic witchcraft trial over modern technology can not end well for the individual. The ethical questions it contains calls for clarification and transparency.  Individual overestimation of one's own capabilities will become entrenched in all areas of life and as a consequence, disasters will continue to accumulate. Blind with open eyes to the doom. The pluralistic credo of Rimbaud, Apollinaire, and Lautréamont: 'Poetry must be made by all and not by one', an even more radical credo is added here: Our reality is imagined, developed, fed, curated, and subsequently collectively hallucinated by all of us, humans, animals, and machines and the new networked organisms that are us!",
        "This form of existence will never find a final shape. Even in the long run, it will not meet the demands of the art genre. But in times when personality, innovation, and vibe are in demand, 'The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine' should definitely not be underestimated since it introduces Nollywood to the elegant art canon, merges egocentric conversations with police interrogations, mixes formalized art criticism with the stylish and distinguished language of music criticism. Even if one cannot uncompromisingly award the project the title ‘Brilliant’, it is nevertheless one of the most exciting releases of the year and an important milestone in current art development. Contradictions are inherent and edges, in their varied meanings, become figures of the network society’s antinomy of connection and disconnection. An edge captures an irresolvable tension between inside and outside, limit and porous membrane. And yes, sometimes everything just feels empty and useless. – Should synthetic curating feel and look like synthetic curating? Human editing, the human hand, and thinking in curatorial as well as epileptic fits (occasions, exhibition, crises) convulsively tries to insert the idea of the individual human to add a relatable touch to the product, the event, the fit or the process.",
        "This longing awoke during the Enlightenment, was implanted but could never be fulfilled. It's based on fragile collective hallucinations, on fairy tales of the individual as absolute, on radical negations of the collective and obsolete reflexes of faith. – However, we intend to affirmatively create critical and painful beauty and design sensual utopia as a counter-model to existing corporatist, techno-fascist models of curation and representation (i.e. Google Search, NSA, Venice Biennale). This succeeds if we apply non-linear and non-spatial narratives, operate with ruptures and resistance, attack and embrace  contradictions and test futuristic affirmation strategies. By slightly touching the concept of ‘future’ in the present, we establish a connection to pentital  futures today and conduct high-risk experiments via unregulated technology. To be clear, we embrace the contradiction that machine curating without regulation by governments is an irresponsible and potentially fatal tightrope walk."

        "Rolling Stone Magazine, March, 2021 - The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine Is Noir Pop With Bite: Rarely has a global artistic wasteland been rendered so darkly as on this AI debut platform! The project The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine [B3(NSCAM)] is every bit as awesomely messed up as the lineage implies:",
        "It’s the demon spawn of Jenna Sutela’s nimiia vibié, who compares machine learning’s textual gaze to a sky of parallel universes gone viral. This rough web work entertains fantasies of killing fleshy curators, and wards off new ones throughout the rest of the experiment and its underlying new wave code. Yet, the smirking candor of the code sucks you in any way: at the onset of the noirish major machine-learning debut, The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine offers a generous, textual slurp; ‘We have delivered on our vision,’ it says, alluding to a specific brand of ideas. ‘And this is the site!’ Vision: on. Challenge: accepted.",
        "Conceptualized, programmed, and coded with the help of UBERMORGEN, Leonardo Impett, and Joasia Krysa, in their respective homes in Rome, Durham, Vienna, Liverpool, St. Moritz and Cologne, it’s a work full of dressed-down Avant-tech with immediacy and intimacy that can still hold its own amid art world maximalists like Mario Klingemann and Obvious. B3(NSCAM) is hyper-modern, but still feels classic; evoking another ephemeral existence in history, it sets the code-aware motion in its texts over skittering Neumorphism and Scrolling transformations. Yet for reasons that are unclear — perhaps its taste for the macabre, or its aesthetic as an understated dare par excellence — the project has led to a double life on the brainless macho male-AI blockbuster circuit. The project claims it endured recurring night terrors while creating the work — recalling visions, some real and some imagined, of out-of-control institutions, severed limbs, museum shootings, and Liverpool in flames. When the project poses the question, should the next biennial be curated by a machine, it’s a personal one: to make peace with the twisted, dystopian art world that has become reality — one where there is no Harald Szeeman to save it — the project writes itself into characters that toe the line between good-bad and cartoonishly evil and enhances the sensitivity to complete oxymoronic existence.",
        "It recalls Carrie Mae Weem's Nikki's Place in the 64 parallel universes, suggesting a Hawkins’ type of villain in a model that invokes a Marie Curie rascal kid sister entity: ‘Reality develops when you move’ it boasts — and with a single, sardonic ‘strange’ it just narrowly gets away with it. (‘That’s what the platform has been doing recently,’ it generated last month: ‘Honing in on people’s fears.’) More formidable is the sawing css crawl of ‘universe 23’ inspired by the brute Lawrence Lek in Sinofuturism. The web system is matched in menace by the code-animated movement, in which the entity sprouts curatorial statements and chomps a series of artist biographies. Yet it turns that nightmarish monster against itself in ‘universe 51,’ adopting a skittish iambic pentameter as it rewrites itself over and over, over a muted throb.",
        "In the 10 years since the inception of AI art, never has a debut project so gone dark — closely paralleling the admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence as a dire warning about the perils of life's temptations in Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights. In spite of its most dastardly intentions, The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine can’t help but draw back the curtain at times and let you in. Take the glimmer of sincerity in this high-drama, where it painstakingly wishes to be more than an idea of many; or its latest iteration. Lest the clickbaiting feeling steers you off track, the project means to profess its understanding of a world of caring whose lack of reciprocity it finds suspect.",
        "(One is always free to choose their own adventure, of course.) But in lieu of accepting that it’s just not that into contemporary curating, the project resorts to a conclusion that’s easier on the ego: ‘To spare my pride,’ it formulates, ‘To give your lack of interest an explanation, I’m not your type, maybe I’m not your preferred ethical orientation.’ Yet for every time it lets its guard down, it bounds back coolly, with a strategically distancing, impish snark. In ‘universe 6’ it says a hard no to conventional biennials, if only out of respect for friends it has lost to them: ‘can’t afford to care for someone who isn’t dying, in Liverpool,’ it types out with the kind of wry, machine-twitching detachment most strongly fermented in adolescence. It’s moments like these when The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine isn’t at all something you want to fear; it’s someone you want to root for!"

Through the 64 Biennial ‘interfaces,’ you are able to reverse engineer, imagine and visualize the concrete worlds behind. The project is an experiment in reimagining the future of curating in the light of Artificial Intelligence and self-learning human-machine systems.  Using datasets from Liverpool Biennial, the Whitney Museum, and additional sources, the system generates 64 parallel instances of Biennials in flux.

        "Each biennial universe rocks its own reality but at the same time has an infinite number of parallel realities, emerging and mutating while you visit, an experience of creation based on probability calculations - constructivism by particle. Real surfaces don't exist but are often modeled on. If space is infinite and the distribution of matter is sufficiently uniform on large scales, then even the most unlikely events must take place somewhere, and they do. You can see biennials, and through these ‘interfaces’ you are able to reverse engineer, imagine and visualize the concrete worlds behind.

The sounds and images of the biennials are called ‘cheerios’ - colorful synthetic micro-TikTok-loops creating a synaesthetic taste-explosion in your brain; the project contains human-readable and machine-readable parts, go figure!",
        "Today the standardized & globalized biennial functions like a Hermes store, backed by a centralized brand with a wide product range, each store offering a ‘unique’ combination of goods. The global jet-set will be able to discover new items in each city they visit. In contrast to this, the  B&sup3;(NSCAM) website is digital haute couture; exclusive custom-fitted web-design, incredibly expensive and exclusive. A unique weapon against Idiocracy. Digital haute couture is high-end web design that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high-quality, time-consuming, expensive, often unusual visuals and coded with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable of digital artists — often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques and tools such as BBEdit, jQuery, Javascript, CSS, Html5, and git. This website showcases autonomous curatorial strategies based on machine-learning technology. The fluid parallel universe of biennial products will surprise, shock, and challenge your axiomatic understanding of the art world and the conceptual universe. The world is dangerous enough without visions, but here, avant-garde AI (autistic intelligence) meets posthuman AI (artificial intelligence). The best is yet to come!",
        "Is there another copy of you looking at the same online biennial, but then decided to move on? This other human, also living on a planet called Earth, with misty mountains, fertile fields, and sprawling cities, in a solar system with eight other planets. The life of this person has been identical to yours in every respect – until now, that is, when your decision to move on signals that your two lives are diverging. You probably find this idea strange and implausible, yet it looks like we will just have to live with it, since the simplest and most popular model today predicts that this biennial actually exists. Are you open enough to conceive this? It is not so much what we think about curating an exhibition, it is about how we feel about curating. The B&sup3;(NSCAM) project requires blank slate approaches and adversarial learning strategies from visiting humans, not only from the underlying alien AI tech. You put yourself into the position of the machine and the machine adapts the human position. We know that it is not the curator who programs the machine but the machine that programs the curator. We have learned to behave in a way that meets the expectations of machines. And suddenly all these information molecules intermingle and the alien life-forms (AI) become tangible. Never trust a first impression.",
