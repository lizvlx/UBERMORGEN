Because of this he has been attacked by name-calling and vilified by his country\u2019s political elite. Botdorf is not interested in debate or in the creation of new forms of artistic expression.

Inspired by the late artist\u2019s operatic visions, new works in modern art and artistic history are progressively spun off from the themes and narratives of his own productions. In his critically acknowledged 2010 film Solaris\u2019, Zappala illustrates the way in which cultural and artistic ideas can simultaneously embody and contradict one another. The visual and spatially explicit nature of his documentation of Solaris 11 caused a sensation, and he received an outpouring of support and media attention that has seen his work rediscovered and seen it reworked.

He has developed a system to mark the spaces in his life that are lost or otherwise altered within the rigid framework of established relationships. \n\tIn the 1960s, Piontkowski introduced the world to the concept of Chobimela, an inbuilt, habitual response to threat or pain experienced by humans.

In the late 1970s, Glanville initiated Bluecoat, a collaborative art practice that became a worldwide phenomenon, including collaborations with Montagnard, Poussin and Labbe\u2019. This intense interest in the politics of art and the commodification of creation is evident in many of the contemporary American artists. \n\tRecent exhibitions include Bute House, Hong Kong (2017); Documenta 11, Mexico City, Mexico (2017); S1 Artspace, Los Angeles, USA (2016); The Studio Museum,",

His expressive and imaginative paintings, drawings and installations draw out the latent latent narratives and intelligences in our cultural and cultural heritage, and in doing so assume a life of their own. Ever since his early fascination with performance and installation art, Choiniere's work has been characterised by his or her extraordinary realism, without which none of us would have realised that we were watching a cartoon. A portrait is cast whenever a hand is needed to stabilize a bouncing ball, and a girl says yes or no to its existence. The rest is as it appears: no girls, no boys, no girl with a baseball in her hand and no one",

His practice revolves around the idea of the body as a social construct subject to power relations, a theme which runs from his preoccupation with brain drain to his ongoing interventions within the construction of institutional systems. Berentson has deployed a variety of technical and non-technical means to further his investigations into what he describes as the \u2018underlying structure of our contemporary world\u2019. These efforts often revolve around the theme of disease\u2019 and the structures of social life, with a focus on mental hospitals, because mental hospitals are typically at the fore of Berentson\u2019s research. Mental hospitals embody certain conventions of civilized life, he points out, and so may be expected to offer models for the",

Drawing on personal and cultural traditions, his work often incorporates found and documented historic events into his sculptural interventions. Inspired by war, revolutionary ideologies, political propaganda, and religious fanaticism, Krulicki\u2019s sculptural works often whole cloth constructions, yet are nonetheless highly conscious works whose messages remain painfully relevant today. Particularly in his recent larger-than-life entities, the surreal is a constant theme, as viewers are constantly confronted with a continuity of consciousness that stops short of complete reality. \n\tFor Whitney Biennial 2016 Krulicki has created \u2018Last Planet Parade\u2019, a large-scale multi-sensory interactive fabric that anchors a",

By linking an art point of view to a popular culture sensibility, Gellman has managed to subvert the former's objectivity and, in doing so, to make sense of the latter\u2019s visual and propagandistic omniscience.

His body of work spans a multitude of media, from photography to video to installation, and from the creation of art objects to the study of specific history contexts. Over the course of his career, Laur has created works that are at once abstract and concrete, creating worlds that humans can empathise with but cannot physically navigate.

The bodies are posed in such a way as to imply violence, but the work does not offer the viewer with any alternative means of understanding the situation. The artist considers the body a living tomb, a surreal place where sinister forces \u2013 embodied in the forms of the bodies \u2013 exert their control.

In his latest installation, a cartoon figure of a monkey wearing a sari and a white turban walks into a darkened room. The room is darkened further by the presence of a second figure: a woman in a flowing turban and a matching robe.

        "The Biennial of the Americas is an international event celebrating the ideas, culture, and people of North, Central, and South America.   The Biennial of the Americas is an international event that celebrates the culture, ideas, and people of the Americas by providing a global stage for leaders in business, government, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropy, and the arts to come together and examine the critical issues impacting life in the Americas. Denver, a city filled with energy, a pioneering spirit, and natural beauty, is the ideal location to host this groundbreaking event and build lasting social, economic, and cultural networks.  The Americas are known for their abundance of natural resources, from oil and gold to agricultural and geographic diversity. While the Western Hemisphere has been politically focused on serious challenges such as drug-trafficking and immigration, it has also undergone a quiet but profound social transformation with great accomplishments that are worthy of celebration.  The majority of the hemisphere\u2019s countries are governed by democratically-elected governments, making it one of the most pro-democracy regions in the world with flourishing cultural and artistic traditions.  Across Latin America there is a burgeoning middle class rising from fresh economic development and making bi-lateral partnerships with the United States and Canada both attractive and important. Finally, new strides toward sustainable energy, public health, education, and public welfare, among others, mean dialogue has become an even more exciting and valuable tool toward social progress throughout the Americas. Despite the wealth of accomplishments, shared interests, and cultural traditions, far too little attention is paid to the Americas as a whole.

        "The Biennale de Paris rejects exhibitions and art objects. It refuses to be \u201dthought by   art\u201d. It identifies and defends true alternatives. It calls for \u201cnon-standard practices\u201d.   The Biennale de Paris was launched in 1959 by Andr\u00e9 Malraux with the purpose of creating a meeting place for those who would define the art of the future. After a hiatus of several years, the Biennale was relaunched in 2000.  Since then it continued to represent an open alternative to the established art world. The aim was to identify and defend the art of the future against the numerous attempts at innovation and mutilation. The Biennale de Paris rejects the use of art objects, which are too alienated by the market. They are not the right format to express the full range of ideas about alternatives. Furthermore, the Biennale de Paris rejects the pretension that art can be analyzed and understood in the same way as other commodities.  Instead, the Biennale de Paris encourages reflection on and interventions by art into the social arena. It attempts to identify and defend the art of the future against the various attempts at transition and mutilation. The Biennale de Paris rejects the pretension that art can be analyzed and understood in the same way as other commodities. The Biennale de Paris refuses to serve as an arena for the appropriation and revision of aesthetic and political positions.  In 1968, the Biennale de Paris resumed as the sole promoter of the Biennale de Paris and expanded its activities. It has since been run by the Biblioth\u00e8que de Paris and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain"
