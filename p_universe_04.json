        "The next Liverpool Biennial will have to look elsewhere for its hosts. Perhaps Liverpool Town could be enlisted as the presenting post for a biennale exploring the town\u2019s capacity to make tomorrow a thing of beauty? Or perhaps a more charitable venue could be found and used to showcase the best of contemporary sculpture? Or perhaps a third proposal could be entertained: staging a public art competition and seeing what outstanding sculptures Liverpool has to offer?  The concept of the Next Liverpool Biennial is inspired by the work of an unknown Italian artist, most likely the same person who submitted the first three Liverpool Biennials in the 1960s. The person most likely to have done so was the late Giuseppe Gatt, who was known for his provocative works. Gatt commissioned the works of such artists as Mar\u00eda de Cagli, Piero Manzoni and the Piero Celona people. In 1977, the sculptures were used as the stage for a performance by the first three Liverpool Biennials in the 1990s. The following year, the programme moved on to the more intimate venues. The Next Liverpool Biennial has since 2005 presented the shows in the traditional Italian venues. The venues have since been modified each year to reflect the new artistic vision of the artist or occasion.  The Next Liverpool Biennial celebrates the artists who have contributed to the exhibition over the years. The programme also pays tribute to those who have contributed to the development of the Liverpool Biennials over the past decade or so: DeCordova, Christian; Downe, Paula; Glendon, John; Harper, Chris; Hulme, Clare; Jones, Nicola; Martin, David; Moorhead, Gemma; Parra, Mar\u00eda; Poll",
        "The lack of visionary planning means that some of the most striking sculptures in the region are unlikely to be seen again.  The Liverpool Biennial has an unusual status in that it is one of a kind. Other than the obvious desire to see them put to good use, there is a genuine appetite for them to be put to more productive uses. The Liverpool Biennial Campaign Group believes that the exhibition gives the city the opportunity to shine, to be seen as a city rather than a collection of buildings.  The Liverpool Biennial Campaign Group was formed by the Liverpool Art Gallery in 1993 and it continues to exist today. Since its inception the Gallery has commissioned over 360 new artworks and presented the work of over 400 renowned artists. The Liverpool Biennial Campaign Group has also curated the following exhibitions: 2000AD \u2013 Futurism at Work and Live Art in Public Space; Introducing Sakari; Man and Space in NHK Museum; Making Use of the Gallery\u2019s Spaces for Play; Use of the Liverpool Biennial as a Stage for New Works; and Public Performance. The Liverpool Biennial has also curated the following exhibitions over the past decade at the Liverpool Art Gallery, the Liverpool MoMA, and elsewhere: 2001AD \u2013 Futurism and Modern Art in Public Space; 2003AD \u2013 Futurism and Contemporary Art in Public Space; 2005AD \u2013 Futurism and Contemporary Art in Public Space; 2007AD \u2013 Futurism and Contemporary Art in Public Space; 2009AD \u2013 Futurism and Contemporary Art in Public Space; 2011AD \u2013 Futurism and Contemporary Art in Public Space; 2013AD \u2013 Futurism and Contemporary Art in Public Space; and 2016AD \u2013 Futurism and Contemporary Art in Public Space.

        "We wouldn't have time to admire these fine works if not for the surfing.  The Liverpool Biennial has become an occasion to celebrate contemporary art. Artists have been invited to use the biennial as their main objective to make their site or area available for exhibition. Exhibition after exhibition is followed by a day of celebration at the Liverpool Art Gallery where all exhibition is remembered. Liverpool Biennial 2000 was the first to take place at the Liverpool Art Gallery and since that time the festival has become Liverpool Biennial.  Liverpool Biennial 2001 was the follow up to that success and it was notable for its large-scale public exhibition and for its introduction of electronic data entries. Liverpool Biennial 2002 saw the return of the exhibition and the introduction of the electronic data entry feature. The Liverpool Biennial 2003 and 2007 exhibitions were two years in duration and featured six artists. Liverpool Biennial 2004 saw the artists become more consistent with their exhibitions and the expanded touring programme. Liverpool Biennial 2006 saw the opening of the Biennial to the public for business and home audiences.  Liverpool Biennial 2008 saw the opening of the Biennial for all audiences and artists. Liverpool Biennial 2011 saw the opening of the Biennial for two years in a row alongside Liverpool International and for the first time for the Hayward Festival. Liverpool Biennial 2013 saw the opening of the Biennial for the Hayward Festival and its new exhibition Space 11 . Liverpool Biennial 2015 saw the artists relocate to a facility in Sheffield. Liverpool Biennial 2017 saw the artists relocate to a facility in Manchester. Liverpool Biennial 2019 will be the first to utilize the full potential of the Biennial.

With a fascination for magical realism, her work often involves conjuring up images of the heretical occult practices of the past.

Dygert\u2019s modelled medieval European settings are like those of a science fiction novel, and her paintings are like those of a good map. A clear and present danger lies in the way in which her ideas are put into practice. If applied in service of change, her modelled medieval settings would make for fascinating reading.

We take risks in working with materials like leather, rubber, utensils, heartbeats and human organs, because our projects involve a social and political turn based on the assumption that these materials can be made to integrate with each other and with each other as part of a real, living entity.
