The presence of water clearly defines the surface as airless, whereas the absence of air effectively defines the surface as waterless. By introducing imperfect mirrors into the equation, Dai Pang (b.1968, Sydney) has created a perfect example of how to think about surfaces in relation to each other. Pang used an imperfect mirror to create an artificially hollow circular space within which he placed his sculptures. His method was to first sprinkle small amounts of translucent wax onto the surface, which he then rubs lightly on the glass surface. This created a mirror image in which the reflection of light was mirrored by the mirror. P",

Her strong preference for large-scale, ambitious projects has led to her collaborations with a broad range of artists, from experimental hip-hop video to traditional epic fictions and westerns. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016 Sibanaz has created \u2018Last Planet Parade\u2019, a work that transforms the pages of a diary into a gigantic sunflower that can be seen from across the Mersey.

        "Bilan Sibanaz (b. 1967, Jerantut, Malaysia) lives and works in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. While not directly associated with the fashion world, the artist nevertheless manages to find a playful and dry humorous value in the cacophony of contemporary American and British advertising. His installation for MADE UP entitled Happy Days (2008) depicts seven deliberately mismatched brightly coloured balloons slowly lowering into the backyard of a desiring viewer. The brightly coloured projectiles gently jostle for position in mid-air above the symbolic seven stars and enter the private sphere of a local family's backyard. In their tranquil interlude, the colourful projectiles illustrate one of the sacred hours of the Islamic calendar, the Slope Steril, or Slope Edibility Period. During this time, the artist suggests, the safest course of action",

The artist's mission statement for each project differs, but the gist is the same: To create spaces in which the artist can share her artworks in a manner that is transparent, accessible and participatory. Each project consists of an art object, typically a sculpture or artwork, that is manipulated or augmented by a physical act of activism: the act of pushing, pulling or smearing. For Touched, Sibanaz made an important step towards this end by creating and inhabiting an existing structure: 'a structure that is built not to be knocked over, but poised as a temple to an invisible enemy'. The statue is a powerful statement of",

        "  The 20th Liverpool Biennial was held in 2003 and featured artists such as Declan Donnelly, Daniel Boulton, Mark Wallinger, Adrian Younge, Tom Sykes, Richard Wilson, Brian King, Stellan Skibbe, Dave Chidiacono, Mark Rufo, Karl Pilkington, and more.  Liverpool has an unusual position in the global pecking order when it comes to music. It is the only city in Britain without a music museum. However, it has an enviable reputation as a vibrant and progressive music city. This can be seen in the hundreds of live music shows per year, from indie to major artists, cover bands to dance artists, electronica to pop. Liverpool has an unusual position in the global pecking order when it comes to music as many young and mid-career artists turn down the opportunities in the cities where they grew up for artistic fuchsias.  Thus Liverpool Biennial offers new spectacles of artistic endeavour and aesthetic encounter, in the same cities where the history of music and music has been embedded for over thirty years. Liverpool is a city of creative workers and artists and it is this that gives Liverpool Biennial its riches.  The first incarnation of Liverpool Biennial was staged in 1984 with a view to renewing old debates around the subject and introducing new ideas about what music can tell us about the contemporary world. The idea was to take existing art collections and commission artists to use them as the basis for a new biennial exhibition. Artists were asked to respond to the history of music and art through the work of some of the most prolific and influential figures in the history of the art scene.  The concept of combining existing art collections with new",

        " The prospect of a renewed civic engagement around the Liverpool waterfront should deliver a galvanising experience for local residents. Liverpool has been home to a diverse range of creative communities for over a century, with a past of inwardness and isolation nowhere more apparent than in its history than in its history with Liverpool. It is these experiences that provide the backdrop for this ambitious new biennial, which should present the city in a new light through the lens of fresh research and analysis.  The Liverpool Biennial of Young Art is the first such venture for Liverpool and the first involving artists aged under 30. The Liverpool Biennial of Young Art is a new, local initiative that sees the arts capital of Greater Manchester and its surrounding area as the driving force.  Why Liverpool? Because it is where we stand today when we count down the days to midnight until dawn. There is something hopeful about the vision emerging from the rubble. There is something hopeful about the way the work of young people is beingfostered and the opportunities they present. There is something hopeful about the way the city is being reinvented, its physical and cultural spaces re-imagined with the new found wealth of imagination and intelligence. There is something hopeful about the way the creative industries are forging ahead with plans for a new \u00adpost-industrial Britain. There is something hopeful about the way the creative industries are forging ahead with ambitious new ideas for young people to discover, engage and engage with. There is something hopeful about the way the creative industries are bringing together world-class artists and young people from diverse backgrounds.

There is something curious about the way the creative industries are plying their trade across",
        "  The Next Liverpool Biennial should be seen as the most radical departure from the established traditions of contemporary art. It does not pretend to have the answers to those questions. It is an invitation to engage instead of an offer of tentative tentative suggestions.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is the most inclusive of all the existing biennials. It is committed to the possibility of imaginative engagement rather than rigid adherence to form. It attempts to respond to the materiality of the present and the shifting of its coordinates. It encourages imaginations rather than confirming them.  It is the product of a changing artistic milieu and a changing politics. It seeks to be a politics of possibility rather than confirmation of the past. It seeks to be a politics of possibility rather than confirmation of the present. It seeks to be a politics of possibility rather than confirmation of the future. It seeks to be a politics of possibility rather than confirmation of the present. It seeks to be a politics of possibility rather than confirmation of the past. It seeks to be a politics of possibility rather than confirmation of the future.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is firmly rooted in the ethos of the transitional period that has shaped the cultural landscape of Merseyside after the Second World War. That era of intense artistic experimentation spanned four decades and saw several movements develop from the direct challenge of creating new works of art to creating permanent installations in the landscape. The period ended abruptly on 31 March 1990 with the Manchester Arena bomb blast. The attack was carried out by fanatical Muslims who had lost their homes and businesses to the bombing. Over 90 people were killed and many more injured.  The Next Liverpool Biennial has its roots in the traumatic period immediately following the bombing of the Manchester Arena in May 1990"

Fans want it both ways: uplifted lands harnessed to industry equals depressed spaces reflecting dwindling population densities and anxieties.If",

The conference, which was terribly put out of its quotidian life, recommenced yesterday with a Ponte City SuperJail, released December 2016, in which artists occupied property underlying six Baltimore rivers and adjacent urban estate sites. Monuments to video art were submerged under a modified or silent Black Tent architecture. Protest motions, labeling the building \u2013 much to the consternation of neighbours\u2013\u2013 seemed unconventional, even banal. Where had they thought these six or seven unnamed urban spaces would end up? Weird urban machines repurposed as political filmmaking platforms.\u00a0Thought expedients aside, really seeing art as facilitating a cure for latent urban ills is the real clearest and most useful assault on perverse strategies of governance and industrial violence punctured through without a struggle or challenge. Integrating arts solutions into not only administrative (law and order) frameworks help bleed preventative dislocations and bleeding cores out of thuggish problem spots. Instead of thicken sedums that harness mediocre art as the regulatory backstop that puts citizens and local communities on viable policy ground, (D)espace reality-tracker[1] works is sending a signal to consumers,\u00a0factoring into just such arbitrage the realities of open or semi-permeable relationships between people repurposed as battlefield tech, pseudo-intellectual heterokiller technologist and other socially prone professions ripe to abuse from ethically dubious means.
