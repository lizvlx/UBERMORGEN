        "Press Release: The Biennial of the Americas is an international event celebrating the ideas, culture, and people of North, Central, and South America.   The Biennial of the Americas is an international event that celebrates the culture, ideas, and people of the Americas by providing a global stage for leaders in business, government, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropy, and the arts to come together and examine the critical issues impacting life in the Americas. Denver, a city filled with energy, a pioneering spirit, and natural beauty, is the ideal location to host this groundbreaking event and build lasting social, economic, and cultural networks.  The Americas are known for their abundance of natural resources, from oil and gold to agricultural and geographic diversity. While the Western Hemisphere has been politically focused on serious challenges such as drug-trafficking and immigration, it has also undergone a quiet but profound social transformation with great accomplishments that are worthy of celebration.  The majority of the hemisphere\u2019s countries are governed by democratically-elected governments, making it one of the most pro-democracy regions in the world with flourishing cultural and artistic traditions.  Across Latin America there is a burgeoning middle class rising from fresh economic development and making bi-lateral partnerships with the United States and Canada both attractive and important. Finally, new strides toward sustainable energy, public health, education, and poverty reduction, among others, mean dialogue has become an even more exciting and valuable tool toward social progress throughout the Americas. Despite the wealth of accomplishments, shared interests, and cultural traditions, far too little attention is paid to the Americas as a whole.  The Biennial of the Americas, therefore,",
        "Press Release: Liverpool Biennial Trust (@LBIttouring) \u2013 the biennial exhibition is \u00a92015 Liverpool Biennial Trust.All of the artworks in the LCBT are \u00a9 2015\u20112017 artists and organisations, and are on view at the Trust\u2019s venues or can be purchased from the Liverpool Biennial Shop. The Trust also produces The Liverpool Biennial: A Year in Exhibitions , a year long programme of exhibitions and events committed to the exploration of visual expression.  The LCBT oversees the Liverpool Biennial Trust, which is a registered charity. All of the trustees are active and committed to the pursuit of art criticisation.The LCBT was founded in 2005 and it\u2019s trusteeship structure is based around three independent organisations\u2014the LCBT Institute, the LCBT Art Gallery and the Literary Fund. In each environment, the LCBT has a seasonality, commissioned work appearing in smaller numbers in regional and international exhibitions across the city of Liverpool. The LCBT also has a yearlong programme of events dedicated to celebrating art critics, with the aim of recurring exhibitions appearing in local venues.  The LCBT Brief History of the Biennial is as follows:  In 1998, the LCBT launched the inaugural Liverpool Biennial as a major art event, to be followed by a three\u2013year commemoration period. In 2004, the festival was renamed Liverpool Semester , and in 2006 the programme was re-establisheded to include a semester-long exhibition and programme of related events. The next edition, The Liverpool Biennial: Year Zero , took place in October 2014.  The 1st Liverpool Biennial, The Year Zero , took place in April 2015. It was the first time",
        "Rafting the profile of Liverpool art biennale, the exhibition set out to display a bold new vision of town and countryside, set against the backdrop of active contemporary culture.  The exhibition invited artists to engage with the region and its environment, with no preconceptions as to what kind of art they would like to present. Artworks exhibited ranged from experimental to descriptive, touching on everything from jogging to cycling, painting whales, digging ditches, building caves, playing host to indigenous peoples. Entries could be bid on either to present a solo exhibition, a collaborative exhibition, or as a collaborative project with the exhibition.  The winning Artwork was showcased in situ, in situ with accompanying artistic projects at Casa Last Paleo, and in public locations across the region. The Artworks were bid on either as individual pieces or as a set in series artefacts, which formed a unique exhibition artifact. This set was completed by a presentation at the Museum of Art, with a closing reception at the Liverpool Art Gallery.  The Liverpool Biennial was founded in 2001 by the Media Art Centre Foundation as a non-profit organization to provide a platform for artists to bid on the commission of new works. At that point the festival was heading towards oblong periods of austerity, with few resources available for new artistic output. In 2010, the festival re-emerged from its winter hibernation to engage with the local arts community and audiences in dialogue. It has since engaged with the arts community again, this time in partnership with the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. The collaboration has resulted in three full years of activity in the arts and programming, with artists being commissioned for new projects every two years. These engagements have included concerts, performances,"

        "Of affordable and low-cost products that were already on the way and were only now being unveiled.Rosalind Reid, a former director of the Tate who has worked closely with the Tate, and a former director of the Department of Art and Design of London, called the exhibition \u201ca great success.\u201d As the exhibition drew to a close, Reid tweeted: \u201cHad a phenomenal time at the Tate. I didn\u2019t expect to be working on such important projects as this for so many years.\u201d The five-day event, \u201cIn the Garden: Art and Consumption\u201d (2019), drew some twenty thousand visitors, including Michael Chabert, Haris, and Patricia Arquette. For the Barcelona pavilion, the next stage of the project will involve a redesign of the FIM Grand Prix, a multi-hundred-seat exhibition space that will reopen in 2020 and will comprise galleries, restaurants, and a library.The project will also introduce a new digital platform that will allow the Tate to better engage with the Barcelona community. Currently, the Tate has a Facebook page. The site will also receive a reimagined appearance in the 2019 edition of the Tate\u2019s \u201cIn the Garden: Art and Consumption\u201d and will be redesigned for the event.

The postponement followed a state of emergency declared by President Emmanuel Macron in early March, which called for the closure of institutions, the suspension of construction, and the curtailment of activities that were scheduled to take place in the region between March 17 and March 19.The announcement of the emergency measures marked the first time the Art Newspaper saw the entire exhibition canceled due to the coronavirus. The show was due to open on April 3 and run until April 7. The Grand Prix\u00e9e d'Art et d\u2019Histoire, an annual prize presented by the French Ministry of Culture, had also been canceled due to the coronavirus.In an interview with\u00a0Artnet, the official French news agency, Ambassador Youssef Al Saadi stated that the canceled exhibitions were made due to the emergency measures: \u201cAs soon as the authorities declare a state of emergency, the exhibition organizers have an obligation to protect the exhibition and to react accordingly.

        "Yashvir Schrowder (b. 1981, Temryuk, Russia) uses the published accounts of history as the basis for his artistic development. He takes the chronological narratives that we have been taught at school and pulls them apart, revealing the patterns of social reality that have been imposed on us by society. In his practice, lived history classes are dismantled in favour of a more confrontational subject matter: the viewer is confronted with a series of direct quotations from contemporary Russian and English history textbooks. These quotations are analysed and altered to create narratives that are at once amusing and disturbing, yet which simultaneously question our contemporary understanding of the world and the status of existence itself. \n\tFor \n\tDangerous Ideas, Schrowder presents a new series of subversive textbooks entitled15\u6708\u7248 (2016), which are distributed",
