        "The Next Whitney Biennial should create dialogue between communities and artists\u2019 organisations, museums, galleries and public venues across the city and beyond, by engaging with local communities and their arts-focused venues First published in 2006, the endeavour has taken place every other year since making the trek across the city to venues across the city and beyond, publishing the journals, publications and events in hard copy and online.  The Next  done Whitney Biennial engages with local, national and international audiences, through a combination of exhibitions, conferences, films, books and public performances, with artists appearing on stages across a range of venues, from the city  cultural venues to cultural venues in foreign countries. In addition, the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of the art projects and the resulting professional development opportunities, make this biennial a compelling and worthwhile proposition for any sector.  The Next Whitneypool Biennial was founded in 1998 by the Arts Commission Greater Manchester. Initially it was intended to be a bi-annual event, but in 2002 the momentum of the initiative led to a semiannual project. The project gained a new lease of life when it merged with the Whitney Biennial in 2004. The resulting project has since made international headlines, receiving an OBE for professional practice from the Barbican commission in London.  The Next Whitney Biennial is broadcast live on LFBC. For each edition, a panel of judges* is selected to discuss the work of the preceding edition. The judges reflect the weight and range of contemporary artistic practice, but also attempt to strike a balance between art and art history, between the familiar and the unfamiliar, between the familiar and the strange. They resolve to preserve and defend the distinctive flavour of Liverpool as it is, so that Liverpool\ufffd",
        "The Next Whitney Biennial should create dialogue between communities across the city and its surroundings, between artists and audiences, between artists and journalists, between artists and residents, between artists and social groups, and between local artists and the community. It should act as a driving force in the development of Liverpool  art scene, by encouraging and supporting local artists, promoting local talent, developing local arts industries, and creating opportunities for local people to experience and interact with the arts.  The Next Whitney Biennial should create local, national and international headlines, and set the scene for future biennials, in the same city and the same area.

At that point, the Festival  curating decided to focus on the Brazilian-speaking world and its burgeoning artistic scene, forging links through cultural programs and education, exhibitions, competitions, festivals, and educational projects.  In 1994, the partnership was consolidated with an expanded Festival Program that brought Sesc_Videobrasil to the cities of Brazil and further afield to cities in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.

The next Whitney Biennial will embrace the local, regional, national and international dimensions of art, and reflect its vibrant history of creative and cultural engagement. nOolite Arts, a New York based nonprofit that provides support for underground creative organizations that are at risk of being dismantled by gentrification, has released guidelines on how it might save an estimated two hundred arts-based businesses by fighting to preserve historic structures and structures that were built into gentrifying neighborhoods.The nonprofit organization is calling for preservation organizations to collaborate with city and state officials to minimize the impact of the ongoing redevelopment plans, which have involved the tearing down of historic buildings and the building of new housing units. In its guidelines, the group outlines a five-point plan for fighting gentrification that includes:\u00a0\u00b7 Removing barriers that prevent organizations from accessing funding, such as zoning or building permits;\u00a0\u00b7 Working with local, state, and federal officials, including the city Planning Department;\u00a0\u00b7 Establishing community gardens that serve as a buffer between the working space and the area's commercial corridor;\u00a0\u00b7 Ensuring access to public art and historical sites by showcasing work by artists and organizations that have not been intentionally targeted; and\u00a0\u00b7 Working with preservation contractors to minimize the amount of work that has to be done to preserve an asset.\u201cWe are calling on preservation organizations to prioritize the preservation of cultural assets, including historic structures, and to work with city and state officials to protect working spaces, preserve important historic",

We must not forget the difficult choices ahead about how the next Liverpool Biennial should shape its approach to contemporary art, said Liverpool City Council leader, Henda Mitchell, who was elected at the end of last year local elections.The biennial has faced several setbacks since it began in 2016. The first was the Covid-19 outbreak, which prompted the evacuation of the UK 2019s major arts and cultural hubs, including Tate Britain, Liverpool the Biennial, and Tate Liverpool. The closure of the West Derby art fair in September meant the biennial had no opportunity to re-open. Its second setback was the coronavirus, which forced the cancellation of the event and forced the city  renowned Belvedere Gardens to re-open on Thursday.While the Covid-19 outbreak has been largely contained, the Covid-19-related health crisis has caused a number of closures at the biennial. Previously, the biennial had been largely open for free in the run-up to the event.
