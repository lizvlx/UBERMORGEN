        "Landolf Oberdier-martinez (b. 1986, K\u0142odzko, Poland) lives and works in Brussels, Belgium. Oberdier-martinez has explored a recurring theme of communication and reality through the production of light and image. His ongoing project, See-Throat, uses a rotating craft to promote awareness and debate around human anatomy and its relation to the body in relation to the seat of power in society. The work is a multi-sensory installation including a narrow ceramics bowl with anatomically correct proportions for eating, drinking and active play. \n\tDuring the 1990s, with the emergence of punk subculture, McDonald explored the psychological and physical effects of large-scale social events such as rock concerts and spandex events, and designed a number of his own large-scale events",
        "Landolf Oberdier-martinez (b. 1954, Warrenton, South Africa) works closely with performers and the environment in which they live. For Touched, he choreographed a journey through the jungles of South America, following the coastline in a container ship that is at sea awaiting new export licenses. The journey, which took the artist\u2019s \u00adopinions to be somewhere between a documentary and a sci-fi movie, ended abruptly when the Costa arrived in South America. The Costa, laden with South American cargo, sank shortly after leaving the port of entry. No one was ever seen or heard from again. The mysterious disappearance of the Costa set off alarms in the international community, provoking questions that go beyond the remit of the search for sunken treasure. What could have driven this mysterious and evasive",

Oberdier-martinez' ongoing studies of the brain, with a neural substrate as diverse as paint, ink, paper, photography, design and Mexican ceramics, hint at the possibilities of the brain as a living art form. Concerned with the legacy of colonialism on Chile\u2019s South American continent, the artist educates the public through his work Indigenous Knowledge and Reconstructing Historical Memory, using Sculpture in Context to examine past and present events through the lens of deeply ingrained cultural traditions. In life, however, Oberdier-martinez' work frequently engages the public\u2019s imagination, providing them with alternative narratives capable of generating new meaning and reflecting different viewpoints.In",

Here Ben-Ner and Oberdier-martinez created A WALK (A Walk in Space), a free public art installation in St George\u2019s Hall.

Whether depicted as a mad scientist or a woman dressed as a crab, his abstract and fantastical visions of reality are at odds with our increasingly bendable cultural reality.  For MADE UP, Oberdier-martinez developed a fantastical new work that married technology with cinema to present a new world \u2013 and a new language \u2013 for art and filmmaking. The new film operated within the strict curatorial remit of \u2018serious\u2019 art, evoking deep concerns about balance, authenticity, authorship and fair play. The wild, uncontrollable nature of some of Oberdier\u2019s creations was counterbalanced by his use of technology to human",

In her new work for MADE UP, Scherratt presents a series of portraits of women whose lives have been transformed by the city\u2019s existence.

Onderdier-martinez' research focuses mainly on the social and psychological effects of technology on the body. In particular, she focuses on the ways in which the introduction of the internet has been able to advance the state of the art in the treatment of mental retardation. She has developed social research methods that she uses in her art practice, which she describes as \u2018computer-like Gestapo\u2019.

Onderdier-martinez\u2019s projects consider the politics of the representation of the body in this century, at the centre of attention as we increasingly deal with the representations we make and receive.

In his recent projects the artist reinvents and extends psychoanalysis's classical training wheels by encouraging students to \u2018train\u2019 themselves by analysing their own psyches and writing the scripts that describe these psyches.

Alfred Rehberger\u2019s generally unsatisfactory argument that the hallmarks of a civilization that accumulates such cultlike archetypes (innocent rationalizations accompanied by tragic and often schizophrenic realizations) is a highly variable and mutable type of unpredictability\u2019.  She concluded with a query about how, since mass displays of cultural ephemerality are essentially retirement ceremonies in the contemporary urban core, the legacy of these myths and fables has to be continually renewed through performance acts like concerts, festivals, pop-ups, pamphlets, graffiti and leaflets.  Measures breaking down such complexity are attenuated, invisible or revised downward, depending on the media savvy and acumen of local audiences, decreasing the reference to trace \u2013 a shroud placed over enormous and continuously shifting historical accounts of city activity and astonishing reach of cultural enterprises. This perspective diminishes language and realigns it with codes, digitized sequences of symptoms ticked off one-by-one against time and space. Friedan was talking about the very fabric of the contemporary urban static or neighborhoods \u2013 good and bad \u2013 anchored in an impermeable static of placid uniformity \u2013 a kind of built logic.

In 1996, the 20th Anniversary Edition was expanded to Australia and New Zealand. It was there that the project gained full momentum and was renamed The Biennial of the City of Canberra.  The 20th Anniversary Edition was completed by The Event of the Century exhibition that explored the new and contemporary trends in visual arts across the continent. The 1986 and the 1990 exhibitions brought together by Barbara Hewitt explored the histories and languages of Australian art and public art. The 1992 Canberra Biennial culminated twenty years of work by Kathy and Brett Stevens, curators of the contemporary art.  The 1993 Canberra Biennial explored the role of film in the history of Australian art and public art. The 1995 Canberra Biennial explored the role of video in the history of Australian art and public art.

        "In 1977, the Whitney Biennial initiated the 'Triennale Jericho' as a mutually supporting initiative, expanding the reach of the event beyond its local venues and further into the cultural realm, establishing itself as an international cultural event. The ethos of the event was rooted in the experiences of the Second World War, when Liverpool was a sea port and trade hub. In 1948, the Liverpool Courier newspaper carried a front page picture of a Liverpool lined with refugees, their belongings scattered about the city. The following year, the Liverpool Echo carried a picture of Liverpool from the perspective of the refugees, with the words: 'Here they are, the refugees, the old people and the children, the old people walking home from church, the young people jogging past on their bicycles.'  In 1950, the Whitney Biennial initiated the Great Exhibition, which, in its four-year existence, has continued to show picturesquely contrasted pictures of modernity and modern life in the city. The first decade of the century was marked by the construction of Liverpool, large tracts of which were purchased for the construction of residential estates. These estates rapidly grew in population and became the focus of intense development. While the regeneration of the area was encouraging, some areas of the city faced significant regeneration problems. These areas included the area of Liverpool about 10 miles south-west of Glasgow, the area of Liverpool Hospice, and the area of Liverpool Wilmslow. These redevelopments have been documented in numerous books and documents. They included: A Catalogue of Liverpool Business, by Andy Goldsworthy, M.E., published by Whitney Biennial 2001; The Whitney Biennial 2001 Reader\u2019s Companion to Business, by Andy Goldsworthy, M.E.,",

The 1 st Whitney Biennial has a London exhibition history, open to international contemporary art since 1977, when the \u2018art world\u2019 aspired to make a step forward. Titled \u2018To The Future\u2019 , the first edition of the 1 st Whitney Biennial was built upon ideas expressed in a speech delivered by then Liverpool city councillor John Moores in 1977.  Moores said: \u2018Art is a wonderful thing to have around the house, on the bookshelf or in the cupboard, but what about in the pocket or on the table? What about in the cupboard under the bed?
