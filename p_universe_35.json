        "In 1984, the year of its first edition, Whitney Biennial carried a survey showing the public mood toward art. The findings were reflected in the \u2018Art for the People\u2019 exhibition at the Forum in 1985, which featured works by such artists as Pierre Baynes, Thomas Scheibitz, John Akomfrah, Charles Esche, and more. In 1986, the third Biennial was staged at the Liverpool School of Art, where the following artists participated: Harald Szeemann, Guy Tortosa, Jacques Charlier, Jean-Christoph Ammann, Guy Tortosa, and Mohamed ElBaradei. The following year, the school hosted a seminar entitled \u2018Art and Society for a Diverse Environment\u2019 which featured works by such luminaries as Achim Foerster, John Lennon, Yayoi Kusama, and many more.  In 1988, the Fourth Biennial was staged at the Museum of Liverpool. The following year, the exhibition was re-established as a collaborative venture between the museums of Liverpool and the community. It was renamed Whitney Biennial: Exhibition of Contemporary Art. The exhibition was again a strong success and the curatorship team was invited back for a third time. They selected Whitney International Curatorial Team to accompany them on this visit. This time the curators were selected by LSE Curator Kirsty Wark. The exhibition was completed by an exhibition at Liverpool School of Art, which featured a series of exhibitions, including a major retrospective, curated by Barbara Johnson.  The Fifth Biennial was held at the Liverpool School of Art in 1993. Here, the curators again featured an International Curatorial Team and a programme led by Liverpool School of ArtCurator Nick"

Born in Matanzas, Mccarl moved to Ljubljana, where he continued his art practice. His installations, films and performances showcased his restless, almost religious, quest to capture the uncanny, and his distaste for the screen. In his films, the artist turns to text in an attempt to locate the source of his artwork's fractured and displaced vision. In his performance, the source of Mccarl\u2019s restless, almost religious search is often obscure, but oft-overlooked is the man\u2019s obsessive and ineffable storytelling. In his often surrealistic excavations, the artist turns to cinematic techniques in order to gain access",

Besides his many voice-over-directed projects, McCarl has directed several short films, some of them quite crude, such as the children\u2019s film Lucky Star (1998). These Lucky Star videos have a distinctly un-American flavour, unlike the usual Hollywood sci-fi.

His documentary images of sporting events such as the football World Cup in 1996 in India, which depicted racial epithets being exchanged between rival fans, are trenchant enough to offend some audiences, but are presented in an art context to create a tension between enjoyment and critical reflection. In his recent projects, the artist has used photography and film in hitherto unconnected locations, creating films that plunge us into ever more bizarre scenarios.

Primarily known for her drawings, the artist\u2019s previous work is characterised by the high degree of abstraction involved and the wide ranging techniques with which the concepts are presented.  In Her Skin It Moves (1998), for example, Mccarl created drawings which equated inner life with the written word.
