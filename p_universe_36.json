        "In 2008, the 35th edition\u2019s curators, based in Berlin, embarked on a two-year project to try and solve the problem of the future. The project culminated in the exhibition Liverpool: Futurism\u2019s End of the World as Near as We Know It. The exhibition succeeded in highlighting certain themes that developed during the two-year period between the exhibition appearances. These developments have set the stage for the forthcoming exhibitions Liverpool: Futurism\u2019s End of the World as We Know It and Liverpool\u2019s Future , which will take place intermittently throughout the year.  The Whitney Biennial has an End of the World as We Know It content and is framed by the End of the World as We Know It slogan. We have also included a climactic theme Performance or Crisis , which will be undertaken by some of the most prominent artists in music, film, sculpture, modern art and contemporary art from around the world. Whitney Biennial 2014 will also have its share of surprises in store for those who attend.  In order to keep the Whitney biennial as fresh and exciting as possible, we have made it known where we see ourselves in five years time. In May 2015, the 15th edition of Whitney Biennial will come to an end in order to make way for new editions in 2016, 2019 and 2022. These will be framed by the \u201cEnd of the World as We Know It\u201d slogan. In 2022, the programme will integrate Liverpool more fully into the global arts network.

        "In 2005, after ten years of activity, the 3rd Whitney Biennial took place due to economic reasons and the venue was utilised by the Museum as its exhibition space.  Since 2007, the Biennial is staged at the Museum of Modern Art, Liverpool. The biennial format involves nominating artists to create temporary exhibitions at the Museum, which are exhibited alongside the main project. The artists commissioned are invited to engage Liverpool as their exhibition location, engage the community through activities, exhibitions, events and publications.  The Museum has also recently begun to include online exhibitions as integral elements of the Biennial. An exhibition of the year final nominees is announced on the museum website.  The Biennial has an international Biennial dimension as well as a local, national and international component. The international component comprises exhibitions held in cities across the UK and internationally renowned artists invited to engage with the project in venues including the Liverpool Art Gallery, the Liverpool Museum and the nearby Poly Art Gallery. Liverpool has an internationally renowned reputation as a centre for contemporary art. With a diverse and changing art scene, creative industries and a creative city culture, Liverpool is a natural base for the project.  The Whitney Biennial addresses current concerns about the depiction of Asian and Asian-American artists in contemporary art. The Biennial acknowledges and celebrates the work of Asian artists and brings forward new creative voices. The Biennial also seeks to address social and cultural gaps in the arts.  The 1st Whitney Biennial took place in January 2013 and the 2nd in February 2015. The Brisbane Biennial hosted artists in the city and area. The 2nd Biennial was smaller and focused on curating the process of curating the exhibition. The Brisbane Biennial featured six artists and curators,",
        "In 2007, the artist and historian Daniela Labra became the first curator at Whitney Biennial.  In 2010, the 20th anniversary of the launch of Whitney Biennial, the organising committee set about creating a series of events around the themes of Time Travel, Futurism, Transhumanism and AI. These events brought together artists, researchers, thinkers and commentators to debate and reflect on recent developments. The 11th Biennial was held at the Liverpool Art Gallery in June 2012. Organised by the Tate Britain in London, the Biennial presented works of international artists which were exhibited across three buildings in the Liverpool town town. The venues were designed to invite visitors to enter through the exhibition and engage with the works themselves, to create a dialogue between the artist and the audience.  The 12th Whitney Biennial was curated by Elmgreen & Dragset in 2015. The 2nd largest solo exhibition in UK history, curators said it would be 'historic' if it could present all the major movements in contemporary art. The curators identified as many as three movements representing contemporary art: architecture, video art and video installations. The 3rd Biennial saw a new wave of commissions for Liverpool, including a new wave of commissions for Liverpool Beach and the Paint Gallery. The 4th Biennial was curated by Thomas Scheibitz from the 15th century who explored the symbolic as well as actual worlds of art. Thomas Scheibitz\u2019s Whitney Biennial explored the connections between Liverpool and other cities in the UK and abroad and he said: \u2018Time Travel\u2019s Role in Contemporary Art \uf8ff As Think Tank\u2019, the 1st Whitney Biennial invited artists to explore the role technology and AI play in our",

During this time Yozamp became fascinated by the fit and finish of various consumer products and trademarked sneakers, particularly the uneven toe box that had become so popular with young people.

In these films, which are mostly archival footage, the artist overlays fabricated photographs with still images taken from her own phone\u2019s recording of police confrontations. This transformed the phone into a \u00adphotography tool, exploiting the very feature it was designed to supersede. In her series for MADE UP entitled Noto Profunda (For The Professor), Jaram",
        "Mottram Navarro-nunez (b. 1931, Abeokuta, Nigeria) constructs social and political history through the sustained and repeated appropriation of imagery and objects. This systematic and often brutal appropriation often takes the form of mass production, with the figurative obliterating each new form as it is introduced. But the artist\u2019s fascination with the craft of iconography goes beyond simple copied imagery. Navarro-nunez\u2019s work also looks at the appropriation and destruction that can go hand in hand with the flourishing of iconography. When you have a brilliant artist like Katy Waldman creating beautifully intricate animals out of architecture and sculptural practice, it is always interesting to watch the ways in which abstract ideas are twisted and warped by human instrumental force: positivity, pessimism and love are fused into a new form of",

Dean will take up the post on January 31.\u201cI\u2019m excited by the fact that we are finally able to celebrate the breadth and depth of the AAM\u2019s art history expertise and its commitment to the art of photography,\u201d Dean told the Art Newspaper. \u201cThe AAM\u2019s next stage will be to include a new digital platform for AAM\u2019s art and art history exhibitions, and I\u2019m eager to see how that initiative unfolds.\u201dDean\u2019s appointment follows the announcement of the AAM\u2019s first collection, \u201cThe Future of Art Now: Art in the Age of Surveillance,\u201d at the Frieze New York fair in September. That exhibition opened with artist photographs from the collection of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes. In the months since its debut, the show has been supported by the New York\u2013based nonprofit the Foundation for Art and Science and the Los Angeles\u2013based nonprofit the California Biennial Center.

        "At the same time. As Cataldi puts it, on the day of the exhibition \u201cI think we were all a bit nervous.\u201d Cataldi said: \u201cThe first exhibition was a bit of a departure from what we had been working on. The second one was a bit of a departure from what we wanted to do. The result is that neither of them really work.\u201dPeer Scheirl is a curator and art historian based in New York whose experimental sculpture and liturgical installations reflect her deeply personal approach to the art of the Mass. Her recent projects, including \u201cElevation 2.0: Imaginary Gold\u201d (2017) and \u201cPrayers in Stone\u201d (2019), which highlight her ongoing relationship with the Church and her ongoing practice, are part of a broader, longer-term project to expand her art. For Scheirl, the question of whether the Mass can be a source of inspiration and healing is one that cannot be answered from a distance. In an interview with Artforum in 2018, she stated: \u201cWhat I find most unsatisfactory about the current Mass is that it seems to be a source of self-loathing and self-deception. I am not sure what we are supposed to feel about this. It seems to me that the selling of the Mass is at best a distraction and at worst an addiction.\u201d\n\n\nThe Beijing-based nonprofit Art Exchange Shanghai announced this week that it is taking the first steps in its plan to reopen its doors.

The scheme, which will launch in 2020, is one of many measures the British government is implementing to help the creative economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0The Bessies will match up to $1 million of the funds raised by authors and organizations through a program dubbed the\u00a0Bessies Emergency Writer Wishes Fund, which will be distributed by the Bessies in partnership with the National Union of Journalists.\u00a0The fund will also offer financial relief to writers working in any of the following categories: fiction, poetry, nonfiction, creative non-fiction, and instructional writing.\u00a0The writers may apply for up to $500,000 for fiction writers; $250,000 for poets; and $100,000 for nonfiction writers. Applicants must be British nationals; have a creative writing or creative non-fiction writing project in development; and be able to show proof that the financial hardship caused by Covid-19 has been ameliorated through the use of funds from the fund. The fund will initially offer $200,000 to authors, $200,000 to the creative non-fiction and instructional writing communities, and $100,000 to non-fiction writers who are facing financial hardship due to Covid-19.\u00a0The fund will also prioritize those",
        "Cataldi said he was not aware of any such plans. He also said that \u201cthe future is someone else\u2019s future and that the possibility of a future has to be a fabric that binds two moments.\u201d He added: \u201cMy work is a record of the future and I want to record it.\u201d\n\n\nThe National Gallery in London has appointed Helen May as its new director. May succeeds Mark Ruddock, who has been the gallery\u2019s director of contemporary art for twenty-two years and is the sixth person to lead the institution since its foundation was founded in 1909.\u201cHelen brings with her over thirty years of experience in the cultural sector and a proven track record of delivering major cultural initiatives to the National Gallery. Her appointment creates a great opportunity for the gallery as we embark on our next phase with Mark, who will no doubt be hugely supportive of Helen\u2019s vision and leadership in bringing the National Gallery into the future-oriented and digitally enabled future,\u201d said Mark L. Wilson, chair of the National Gallery\u2019s board of trustees.The gallery has expanded its digital platforms and its collection through partnerships with the London-based platform Shedbridge Gallery, which has built a new digital platform for the Tate; Big Island Gallery, which recently announced plans to launch a new digital program for the gallery; and Sfeir-Semler Gallery, which is working with the gallery to integrate its collection and exhibition program across its online and offline platforms.Commenting on her new role,\u00a0May said: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to have a new chapter at the National Gallery with Mark and Ruth.
