Heavy Industry II (1999) is about heavy industry, innovation and the transformation of traditional ways of life. It tells the story of a particular generation of industrial workers, their shift from semiprivate to modern industry, and the changes wrought by the changing times.

He has, after all, become a photographer himself, and uses the language of photography to talk about the culture of his adopted country. The beautiful face of Bangladesh is portrayed in these very tender and self-portra that is done in her homeland. Wisdom, the",

Their combination of low-tech and high-tech media works have been called upon to tackle such sensitive and politically charged issues as migration, climate change, art and architecture, urban planning and much else in between. It is often said that the new world is already here \u2013 the emergence of the ocean as a terminal to this rapid industrialisation is a significant event in world history.

His poetics goes beyond mere affection in its portrayal of the subtle subtext of our contemporary world and also considers the nature of literary criticism. By invoking the work of the late great masters, such as Borges\u2019 The Search for New Tolerance (1998) and Del Rio Japonismo (2005), Headman also contemplates the nature of real discourse and the limits of literary criticism. Using a variety of media, from film to text, to beehives to street signs, to set and constructed imagery, he creates highly concentrated, highly provocative and often deeply meaningful works. \n\tFor International 04 Headman continued his series of paintings called The New Physical Picture",

After leaving school he studied painting in LIberia, graduating in 1967 with a degree in Fine Art. Since his childhood he's been an artist: in his spare time he builds and paints car models, builds toilets and builds replicas of buildings.

Interventions such as 'structures of production' (a term originating in the French movement of the 1960s and referencing the present) can be transformative, creating conditions in which new kinds of economy, politics and aesthetics can be conceived. However, the ways in which things are structured should not be taken as inevitable developments, but are instead questioned and expanded upon. This is typically demonstrated through open-ended dialogue, which engages with issues such as ownership, discourse and so on, producing mutually exclusive ends (the artist\u2019s works diverge from each other and from our perception of reality).\n\tShannon Ebner (b. 1971, Englewood, New Jersey) lives and",

Exploring the historical conjunctions that have produced these bizarre, yet intriguing, accidents of creation, Molleda\u2019s work addresses the viewer\u2019s sympathies through a difficult conceptualisation.  In Red Light (2005), for example, Molleda transforms the double meaning of the word \u2018red\u2019 in relation to the flag.

He is a Spanish artist living and working in San Diego, U.S.A. Although Mater\u2019s work varies greatly in scale and nature, it is consistently captured in dense, tightly wound narratives that leave no room for misinterpretation. The nested, restricted space of these narratives is captured through special mouldings and their animated inhabitants.

His rendering of this iconic genre connects past and present while simultaneously challenging the conventions of comic book storytelling and artistic genre. The voyeuristic angle of this medium is analysed via inverted commas: \u2018The voyeuristic angle is generally directed towards the female body\u2019, and so, in inverting this directness, Davy also inverted the gaze.

        " This has lead to a worrying current of events, which in turn has led to a worrying future.  The first event of our new triennial wave, Liverpool International 2017, was founded upon the premise of returning to the more cosmopolitanist proposition of the 1960s. In a nutshell, we are reintroducing ourselves to a bygone era of music, one that is both familiar and unfamiliar to us, with sounds fresh and old, familiar and unfamiliar, familiar and provocative, familiar and strange, and the stirring of the new breath of the 21st century.  The ethos of the event is rooted in the spirit of the free movement of people and the flow of ideas across borders. This idea of the Liverpool Biennial was incubated by the Liverpool Biennial Trust, which was formed in 2005. Since its inception, the Liverpool Biennial has attempted to use the biennial as a place for cultural activity and discussion, as well as a platform for artists and others to come together and work with us to explore the contours of contemporary art.  The Liverpool Biennial Trust is a non-profit cultural organisation, which was founded in 2003. It is a founding member of the International Secession (ISC) and a member of the Social Democrats (SD) in the European Parliament. Inures Social Service, which is the main provider of social housing in Liverpool. Since 2007, the trust has also provided day-to-day social care services.

        " The results have been unsatisfactory experiences for many artists. The advent of the internet has made it accessible to millions and aural encounters with eccentricities and excess have become the stuff of escapist entertainment. Liverpool has an unusually large and enthusiastic fan base which has enthusiastically embraced the work of some of our finest recent artists. We have also long been an active city which attracts those looking for a social interaction at a low cost who can also enjoy a sardonic sense of humour.  The Liverpool Biennial has an unusual setting in terms of its relationship to traditional art forms. Unlike in some cities, where art is a commodity which can be bought and sold, in Liverpool it is owned by the community. This gives the Biennial the potential to speak to a wide public which may not otherwise have explored the city. The biennial also has a distinctly Liverpool tinge to it, as evidenced by the large numbers of artists who have exhibited across the city. These recent arrivals have set the scene for the future. Liverpool has an unusually high number of galleries which have been set up to house the various disciplines of our art scene. These galleries have a particularly strong presence on sartorial grounds, with some galleries able to host major exhibitions themselves.  The Liverpool Biennial could well become the most important cultural event of the city\u2019s arts calendar in the not too distant future. The city has an unusually rich visual arts sector which is well represented in our Parliamentary Boroughs. The recent appointment of Paul Hollywood as Chief Curator has put Liverpool on the map of contemporary art in the UK and abroad. The biennial could well become a vehicle for promoting both art and politics which brings together art and politics to the fore.  The Liverpool Biennial is supported",

Its structure and purpose have been aimed at combating the situation outlined by Norman Foster in 1932 in which the Liverpool Biennial became a vehicle for the arts.  The first instance of the Liverpool Biennial at this time was the installation of artists in 1938 under the name \u2018Under Pressure\u2019, which featured such luminaries as Roger Bauma, Harry Hay, John Keiffer, Brian King, Brian Moore, Paul McCarthy, Brian Taylor and Andy Goldsworthy.  In 1945 the biennial was renamed Liverpool Biennial and during the war time it was given the nom de plume of \u2018The Liverpool Symposium\u2019. In 1950 the exhibition was renamed Liverpool World Biennial and in 1957 the biennial exhibited works by such renowned artists as Roger Baldwin, Terence Blanchard, Charles Pousset, Paul McCartney, Mahalia Jackson, and Apollinaire.  In 1961 the biennial was renamed Liverpool Biennial of the Arts and exhibited such revered ani-\n\nments as \u2018To My Excellency the King\u2019, \u2018To My Excellency the People\u2019, \u2018All\u2019 Night Long\u2019, \u2018Vertical Man\u2019, and the Documentary.  In 1968 the exhibition was renamed Liverpool Biennial of the Arts and again exhibited the work of such luminaries as Roger Baldwin, Terence Blanchard, Clement Attlee, Joan Mir\u00f2,",
        " The result has been an excess of genuinely convincing, probing, and affecting music that, often, feels wholly disconnected from the cultural landscape. There is a danger that this unforeseeable disconnection may be contributing to the suffocating effects of genre on the cultural landscape, particularly as the digital revolution advances.  The Next Liverpool Biennial acknowledges this unforeseeable future and its impetus of change. We seek to be inspired by it. We seek inspiration from it. We create art that speaks to us, that is our own, and that can be meaningful to us, as individuals, as a community, as a movement, and as a movement seeking to connect communities to one another.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is inspired by the spirit of Liverpool and the place where, as a city, it promises renewed energy, creativity, and engagement. As a city, we commit to building Liverpool\u2019s digital future as one in which our cities, towns, and villages all work together to shape and create meaning.

Yet, the same compulsion to grab at life, and to try to make it, is manifest in both. In fact, most of the work of the biennial is in its first act about the participant, the stranger, the non-native.The first question to be asked is who are these strangers? Well, most of them are not natives\u2014most are between twenty-five and forty years of age. Yet, this is often a group of people who have had little or no contact with one another or any of the local community. They are most often young men who are from the same geographical location and who are drawn to the same aesthetic vibe, the same drugs and the same food. They are often the victims of racism, discrimination and violence, often have little or no connection with their own communities and few, if any, have any meaningful connections with those outside their communities.Usually these strangers are not the people who are the victims of racism. They are often those who have no connection with the communities where they live. They are often those who are on the periphery of social life, who are forgotten, out of touch, or at the margins of society. They are often people in relationships with no connection with the men who are in relationships with them. They are often people who are victims of injustice and often those who have no connection with those who are the victims of injustice. They are often people who have no connection with art and often those who have no connection with the art world. If this is the future of the biennial, or, in fact, the very future",

For most of the twentieth century, the city\u2019s art scene\u2014the region\u2019s pre-eminent cultural enterprise\u2014was largely confined to a few scattered corners of the UK. In the early 1950s, the region\u2019s only museum was set up in a former coal-mine, the Liverpool Biennial. The museum, which lacked a modernist aesthetic but featured works by the likes of Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Ermanno Olmi, and George and Anne Regis, began as a venue for a series of short exhibitions and eventually evolved into a contemporary art museum.In recent years, the museum has experienced both sustained and declining attendance. In 2015, the fourteen-year-old venue, which is managed by the nonprofit Liverpool Biennale Foundation, announced that it would be closing permanently. The museum had been closed since March 2019. A statement from the foundation read: \u201cWe are greatly disappointed that the museum has been closed since March 2019. We believe this is the most appropriate time to close it down.\u201dThe museum was also forced to make room for a $35 million expansion in 2016, following construction on the museum\u2019s building on Queen Street. The museum reopened in March 2018. In 2018, the museum was awarded a Queen Street Walk for its centenary.\n\n\nThe Solomon R.

The result is a distasteful mix.The forthcoming North Liverpool Biennial, an amalgam of contemporary and esoteric British art, will try to redress this imbalance by introducing a new cohort of artists and will attempt to merge the confines of two cities. Joining the forthcoming exhibition will be the artists who have featured on the show so far: Asher Barlow, Jodi Throckmorton-Bolyk, and David Talbot.The show will feature works by twenty-three artists, including Tate Britain\u2019s Max Hetzler, Fontevra Elvira, Craig Smith, and Aida Al-Hadid.
