        ".\u00a0The second part of the show, which is scheduled to open on March 4, should address issues which arise from the voyeuristic gaze of the camera, and should strive to expose the subversive tendencies of media products. The final part, entitled\u00a0Feminism and the Cinema, will talk about the relationship between cinema and modern art practices and will feature interviews with artists, activists, academics, filmmakers, writers, and other figureheads.In the introduction to the show, Mia Thompson, director of the Biennial and a professor of art at the University of the Arts, said: \u201cThe show is an attempt to capture and rethink the relationship between cinema and modern art practices. The intention is to shift the focus away from the current political and cultural framework and towards the esthetic and content of the medium. The show is not a political statement; it is a reflection of a deep and wide-reaching feminist and queer aesthetic.\u201d Thompson added that the artists who will participate in the exhibition \u201cdeeply value the chance to have a say in the future direction of the Biennial.\u201dThe exhibition will take place at the Sotheby\u2019s Contemporary Arts Centre in London from March 4 to March 6, 2020. The National Galleries of Scotland and the National Gallery of Ireland are\u00a0accredited by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and the Tate is accredited by the Association of Musicians.\n\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York has announced that it will eliminate a major work by American artist Ellsworth Kelly, a leading member of the Sisseton Valley Gallery, in favor of a virtual reality work, \u201cLincoln,\u201d that will simulate Lincoln\ufffd",
        ".\u201dIn the same letter, the academics write: \u201cThe power of the Festival is that, without sounding patronising, it can be taken seriously and we can begin to talk about what art can be. How art can be meaningful for those who cannot or will not meet or see it. How art can be transformative for those who are excluded from seeing art. What art can be . . . that gives us hope for the future.\u201dRoe has previously highlighted the Festival\u2019s international scope as a central pillar of supporting artists, and has urged the organisers to \u201cspeak to many voices from all over the world, including from underprivileged communities, and hear their perspectives.\u201d Last year, she said, the Festival\u2019s inaugural edition drew a collective audience of nearly three hundred, and that it \u201cdoes not shy away from challenging convention, but it challenges it in a way that is painfully human.\u201d\n\n\nA group of artists and collectors are demanding the return of more than three hundred works from the Rothko\u2013Garc\u00eda family collection, which includes posters, lithographs, prints, and photographs by the prolific Cubist, painter, and photographer Jos\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9s Garcia, who was the subject of a groundbreaking 1986 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.The artists\u2014as well as members of the Garcia family\u2019s collective Nude with Feminine Love\u2014are demanding that the Louvre, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York make public and return the works by the artists who are demanding the immediate restitution of the Rothko\u2013Garc\u00eda collection.The artists\u2019 letter states:"

        "   The first iteration of the Liverpool Biennial, The Valley Becomes Ours was published in 2006. It followed a year of investigation by the Liverpool Art Gallery into the history and practice of music public access to contemporary art in public spaces. The exhibition, which was divided into three parts, looked at the ways in which music has been embraced and used as a form of protest or as a social catalyst, exploring the different approaches to this theme. Part I examined the ways in which instrumental music has been used to address social issues or as a catalyst for artistic production, inquiry and discourse. Part II looked at the different forms of musical communication and their pros and cons in relation to different social groups and contexts. Part III looked at the various uses of video in relation to different social groups and contexts.  The Liverpool Biennial has established a strong partnership between the Liverpool Art Gallery and the Liverpool Music Academy. This ensures that all the artists featured in the exhibition have had a platform to promote their work and participate in the discussions that have shaped the history of the music academy. This partnership has furtherlined the Liverpool Biennial\u2019s stated aim of providing a platform for innovative and challenging artistic work and promoting excellence within the academy.

        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial should, above all, focus on the work itself, i.e. the actual people doing the celebrating, rather than the artist or art festival. This is a must for successful biennials as it guarantees that the programme will be interesting, challenging and rewarding for everyone.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is firmly rooted in the ethos of the free festival movement. Fostering and stimulating the free expression of ideas about art and culture, it promotes enquiry and experimentation, calling for the most up-to-date and experimental forms of art. It seeks out and demonstrates alternative forms of artistic production, hoping to promote the practice of art and debate in the public realm.  The Next Liverpool Biennial: Sphere of Influence aims to be a public and forum-based event, with participation by non-profit and for-profit organisations, curators, artists, thinkers and communities. It seeks to be a social platform for the debate on public and artistic spaces, as well as for the reflection on leisure and work in society.  The Next Liverpool Biennial: Sphere of Influence was founded by the Liverpool Biennial Trust in 2017. Its vision is to reflect the current mood and state of artistic practice in the country and in the world, so as to reflect on the role and potential of contemporary artistic production and activity. The Liverpool Biennial Trust\u2019s mission is to support and promote the artistic practice of contemporary art and exhibition, both in the UK and abroad. It presents the work of renowned artists from around the world, and introduces new artists and works from within the Liverpool area.

This critique takes a long view, taking on major systems such as television, computers and telecommunications (particularly in North Korea). In his practice, textual and artistic minimalism is welcomed as a new kind of artistic practice. In many of his projects, the textual content is erased or reduced to an abstraction.

The newly commissioned building will be known as El Bar (after the king\u2019s palace), and will take the form of an underground city \u2013 echoing the king\u2019s palace in Jordan \u2013 where art and culture will merge.

        "Tsirla Abrev (b. 1941, Ariyal\u016br, India) has constructed a living, breathing sculpture that resembles the body of a six-year-old girl. The figurine is consumed with a relentless stream of questions: Who is this girl? Where is she? Why is she with me? How do I feel?  Throughout the project we ask ourselves these existential questions, some of which have been posed by sociologists, while addressing previously unasked questions such as: Who am I? Where am I going? How will I feel?The results of this intensive research have been beautifully articulated into a narrative that is darkly humorous, sinister and fascinatingly ambiguous. It is narrated, interjected with doll-like models of horror, sex and violence, and the inevitable philosophical musings of the child",
        "Eleftherios Abrev (b. 1941, Fukumitsu, Japan) often characterises his drawings as the product of a one-year research: \u2018In my year of research, I usually start with a new idea and work my way through the various stages of conception, production and editing.\u2019 He continues: \u2018The final work usually takes me two years to complete, during which I am usually out of the country. But since I started this work I have been asked to suggest new ways in which ideas might be expressed or performed. By combining various artistic methods, such as video, photography, installation, writing, puppetry and live performances, I have tried to create new ways in which to talk, act and express myself. This gives my work a human face and makes it easier for me to conceptual",
        "Erandi Abrev (b. 1941, Cuito, Angola) is one of the most gifted artists working in the 21st century, a veritable visual age-old mystery wrapped up in a modern technological framework. While his conceptual works revolve around the notion of time, its nature and interpretation are never fixed, but rather constantly shifting between symbolic meaning and (often fantastical) cosmic visions. \n\tFor \n\tTouched, the artist reframed the traditional weaving of fabrics into a hybrid that linked the worlds of fabric and canvas. The weaving process itself washes the palette of the artist\u2019s native Angola, transforming it from a deep forest green to a modern day tropical red. The animals (primarily pigs) that the artist used in his paintings then entered a new realm \u2013 they",
        "Maiki Abrev (b. 1941, Larvik, Norway) is interested in how unconscious mind processes change over time. In many ways her work represents a natural evolution in response to the exisiting human condition. Abrev\u2019s initial experiments with yoga\u2011like postures created a state of physiological and psychological anaesthesia. Later attempts at yoga\u2011like postures attempted to arrive at a more rational and spiritual understanding of the human predicament. \n\tFor Touched, Abrev presents her latest virtual reality experience, created with the award-winning virtual reality software Marmite. This new work focuses on Marmite\u2019s ability to induce dreamlike states in its users. The experience, based on the visual style of the artist, is a subtle criticism of the commodification of dreamspace. \n",
        "Aerianna Abrev (b. 1941, Indore, India) is a photographer who lives and works in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In her work, she documents the strong symbolic value of key cultural and religious symbols. Abrev\u2019s ongoing relationship with St George's Hall is documented in the film. In recent exhibitions, the two women have engaged in a dialogue about equality and human rights, including the subjectivity of reality and representation. In her project for Liverpool Biennial 2016 titled \n\tJerome of Jerusalem: The Making of a Supreme Ruler (2015), titled after the \u2018King of Kings\u2019, Abrev analysed the role of government in the lives of ordinary Palestinians. She exposed the construction of official narratives, challenged traditional perceptions of authority, and questioned official narratives presented to the public.",
        "Lorelle Abrev (b. 1941, Kannauj, India) and her burning passion for photography hass the capacity to compel our perceptions of reality, beyond that directly observable in our environment. Abrev\u2019s installations, video pieces and photographsuse of light and colour to create space in which a relationship between place and figure can be created.  She has used street lights, traffic signals, cartoon characters and buildings such as bridges and tunnels to create works that shift the focus from the static world of our environment to the realm of unseen adversaries.  In her new film for the Biennial, titled BIRTHRIGHT (2002), Abrev continues to utilize her longstanding interest in community engagement to create change in her adopted country, Building a Better World (2002). The film focuses on Abrev\u2019s",

        "Godofreda Abrev (b. 1941, Crosby, United Kingdom) has always been fascinated with con artists. He is fascinated by their use of social media, and in his 2009 project Fake It, he duplicated the \u2018real\u2019 television show It's Always Sunny in Dublin, Ireland, using the same basic premise and character. The project was an exercise in righteousness \u2018seeking the truth\u2019, duality at it\u2019s core. The way in which we seek the truth and align ourselves with that seeking is what the game is all about. We meet shamans, healers and renegade therapists on TV\u2019s Shameless, and in the new film, we meet the woman who took it upon herself to seek the truth about husband Scott Iddon\u2019s death by re",
