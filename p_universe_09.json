        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial should manufacture happen\u2011stances becoming monoliths, history that offers lessons for a better future. The Next Liverpool Biennial is the culmination of a three\u2011year plan developed by the Liverpool Biennial Trust.  It began with the intention of looking after the artists in their own right and developing a comprehensive program of events to remember and celebrate the work of outstanding artists from across the world. The first edition, Ten Little Indians , focused on children and young people, with a focus on the work of artists such as Andy Goldsworthy, John Akomfrah, Sunao Tzu and Manfred Klingenberg.  The second edition, The School of M\u00fcnster , focused on young people and young art; the third edition, The Arena , focused on international contemporary art.  The Trust\u2019s strategy for the next edition of the M\u00fcnster Biennial was guided by the principle that it not only made the festival into a festival of contemporary art but also nurtured and developed young and emerging artists.  The 2015 edition, The Arena , welcomed twenty-seven new artists, among them Manfred Klingenberg and Julie Bindel. It was also the first to feature the work of the acclaimed artists from around the world.  The 2014 edition, The School of M\u00fcnster , focused on young people and young art; the third edition, The Arena , focused on international contemporary art.  The first four editions (2001, 2005, 2007) were aimed at young audiences. The seventh edition (M\u00fcnster \u2013 Global Village 2014) was curated by the Guardian\u2019s Zeynep Tufekci.  The 2013 edition, The Arena , was headlined MUNSTER \u2013 The",
        "   Next Liverpool Biennial was first staged in 1999, when the Liverpool Philharmonic mounted a major exhibition around the work of the artists. The aim of the event was to engage with the work of the artists, engaging with the community and other visitors, and creating a contest of places. Liverpool has a long history in showcasing ambitious, experimental, and progressive art. Close to twenty percent of the UK\u2019s artworks are exhibited every year, with new exhibitions regularly appearing on the calendar. Amongst artists commissioned in 1999 were Joseph Backstein, Guy Debord, Tarek Atoui, Christos Halakakis, Neha Nagrajima, Kristina N\u00e9meth, and Franz West.  In 2013, the 20th edition of the Liverpool Biennial was launched, paying tribute to the 25th anniversary of the festival. The programme for the event featured six exhibitions across venues including the Liverpool Art Gallery and the Liverpool Museum. The after parties for the festival featured performances and art exhibitions by Damien Hirst, Christian Dior, Jan Hoet, Christian Korner, Guy Debord, Alia Swastika, and many more.  The 11th edition of the Liverpool Biennial was artist-led, in 2014. The following year, the festival was inaugurated as a yearlong project, with an annual event size of 30,000 exhibition visits. 2014 saw the festival re-established as a continuously engaged event, with new partners across the city and region contributing to the project. 2015 saw the festival re-launched as a summertime event with a new site in Liverpool city. 2017 saw the festival return for a third time, this time taking place in Ibiza.  For the fourth time",
        "    The Next Liverpool Biennial should produce experiences that prove instructive, distill messages from the past, and inject new ideas into the present. The Next Liverpool Biennial engages communities in the exploration of contemporary art and its social contexts. It fosters active, inquisitive young people in the arts and social worlds.  The Next Liverpool Biennial was founded in 2017 as a not-for-profit organisation. It is funded through The Arts Commission and The Liverpool Philanthropies.  In 2019 the Fundamentals Partnership (with the City of Liverpool) made the Next Liverpool Biennial a fully funded, dedicated art event. The event takes place in partnership with a diverse array of organisations and institutions, including the City of Liverpool, the Poly/Graphic Arts Festival Liverpool, the Liverpool Biennial Trust, the Liverpool Biennial Campaign Trust, the Liverpool Biennial Jam, and the Trustees of Liverpool Biennial.  For the 2019 edition, a new \u00a310,000 Public Art Payment was committed and a new emblem was adopted to replace the iconic 200 year-old arch. The new \u00a310,000 Public Art Payment is a legacy of the growth in public funding for art in 2017/18 that enables the biennial to continue. The new \u00a310,000 Public Art Payment provides an annual arts investment of up to \u00a3100,000 that enhances the profile of Liverpool as a place for creative activity and public arts.  In 2020 the Third Sector Philanthropies\u2019 initiative to create Liverpool as a Creative City 2020 expanded to Other Venues. This new chapter in the Next Liverpool Biennial story involves Liverpool in the European context. As part of the agreement, the City of Liverpool has committed to a series of actions to promote",
        "   \u201cLiverpool Biennial: History of Art in Public Space\u201d began in 1997, at the invitation of the Liverpool Biennial Trust. Its aim was to bring Liverpool\u2019s thriving contemporary art scene within the context of the city\u2019s social history, where artists were invited to present their work in public space. Since its inception, more than 1000 exhibitions have been presented in public space across Greater Manchester. The majority of them by local artists, trustees and cultural centres. The venues presented have been diverse in form and quality, presenting both large-scale and familiar public exhibitions in new contexts. The venues have included the following:  The Wadham Centre (directly across the road from the Manchester Art Gallery), the Public Art Gallery (Pakenham, Cambridgeshire), the Manchester Museum (Manchester), the Wellcome Art Trust (Wellcome, Manchester), the Sculpture Trust (Portsmouth, England).  The Liverpool Biennial Trust Art Spaces is a non-profit organisation that has no affiliation with a body in Liverpool. Its members are individuals and organisations who wish to engage contemporary art in public space. Their areas of interest include the following:  Creating and presenting innovative art Experiencing art in public space allows the Liverpool Biennial Trust to expand its remit, and in doing so provides the public with new and relevant experiences. The Trust\u2019s experience in Public Art Space has included commissions for the Liverpool\u2019s Summer Biennale, the Bowery, and the Liverpool Biennial.  Creating and experiencing art in public space has also put Liverpool on the map internationally. Since 1997, the Biennial has been displayed in many foreign cities, and ranked highly on international art festivals like Ok"
