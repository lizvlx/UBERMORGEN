In his recent series of works, the artist literally slaughters animals for the amusement of his subjects. In his unique War and Peace Landscapes (2000), which actually occurred, the artist built a small island from fabric scraps that were collected as rubbish on a road near his home in Spain.

The International Contemporary Art Association (ICAA) was formed in 1985 by African artists who met at the International Contemporary Art Academy (ICA) in Cape Town, South Africa.  Since then it had many incarnations. Initially it was meant to be a platform that welcomed and promoted contemporary art, exhibitions, publications, talks and debates affecting art and culture from Africa and the Caribbean. Today, it functions as a platform that promotes and supports contemporary art and its mediums, performance, movement and discourse.  The ICA is a sectoral, non-profit association with regional and international ambitions. It operates in response to the changing face of African art and the changing role of contemporary art in the wider world.  As an independent, non-commercial, non-governmental organisation, the ICA seeks to play a more active and influential role in shaping contemporary art and promoting African art and culture internationally. Its vision is rooted in a commitment to the eradication of illiteracy and promoting literacy amongst Africa\u2019s youth.  The ICA instills African art and culture through a multiplicity of venues, through partnerships between artists, curators, collectors, art professionals and the general public. This includes publications, courses, workshops and mentoring programmes. Furthermore, the International Contemporary Art Academy (ICA) is a framework for the training and education of contemporary art acolytes in Africa.",

It was one of the most ambitious projects in the promotion of contemporary art in Brazil. The project, which lasted two years and raised over twenty million dollars, featured sixty-seven artists from twenty-six countries. The project aimed at a Brazilian public that was interested in questions concerned with Sport and Memories, about Sport and Past . It was also addressed to foreign audiences, to introduce the concept of Sport to the local audience in Brazil and to the international art community.  The opening themes for the 2006 Rio de Janeiro Biennial were: Farewell to Post-Colonialism; The City of Rio de Janeiro; City of Happiness; and The City of Search for Meaning. In addition, the exhibition concluded with a series of related events drawing twelve thousand spectators from the city\u2019s community and work spaces.

        "Architecture, 10:\u00a0A Short History of Moving   The exhibition proceeds in two streams: a) to acknowledge and commemorate the many generations of inventors, artists, curators, intellectuals, and activists who have made moving in a given city possible; and b) to acknowledge and commemorate those who, through no fault of their own, have made the most of the moment.  The idea of the biennial is to make of it a show and exhibit that is both compelling and provocative, both in location and in content. Locations are selected to present distinct perspectives on history, society, and culture, with a focus on the past decade or so as the new cultural capital of choice for the Haitian diaspora.  The exhibition is accompanied by a series of publications, pamphlets, DVDs, books, and concerts. The works selected for this edition are those that best represent the spirit of the place where they are exhibited.  The biennial was first initiated in 2002, as a public and private cultural event in New Orleans. Following the devastation of the hurricane season, the biennial was renamed the Haiti Biennial and moved to a more permanent location in the city. Since the thirties, the biennial was inaugurated by the US President, in January 2005. Since its inauguration, the biennial made Haiti proud again as a center of cultural activity. The art of the group of moving artists known as the Mekong-Mangos was honored, and a number of famous artists, such as Antoine Temp\u00e9, Jean-Christoph Amilcar, Le Consortium, Le Consortium d\u2019art contemporain de New Orleanse, and Alain Resnais, participated in the exhibition.

        "I am a 26 year old artist based in New York City. I am currently exploring new sources of artistic and social support and new forms of artistic circulation. I am also considering new ways to tour and connect with audiences through performance, film, sculpture, performances, performances, exhibitions, festivals, readings, concerts, readings, concerts, lectures, website presentations, and exhibitions. My answer to your question is: yes, we should build public spaces around art in order to promote a deeper understanding of its past and the present, and also to foster new, subcultures of contemporary art.\u201d\u00a0The Biennial has already faced backlash from some quarters. Artforum critic Paul Mpagi Sepuya and the artist-run collective Anish Kapoor wrote in the September 2003 issue of Artforum that the series was \u201cincompatible with the spirit of the Biennial.\u201d While the exhibition received enthusiastic reviews from the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the Los Angeles\u00a0and the New York Post, critics declared that the show was \u201cnot at all what I expected.\u201dArtforum contributor Lawrie Marden\u2019s contention that the exhibition was \u201cunnecessarily bleak\u201d and \u201centertaining\u201d was echoed by John Senan Jr., the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, who told the Los Angeles Times that the exhibition was \u201ca good first step toward making art even more accessible and accessible.\u201dElsewhere in the art world, criticism was harsher, and art historians were less than complimentary. On the Fifty-Third Venice Architecture Biennial\u2019s Instagram\u2019s account, Richard Conlin wrote that the show \u201cdoes not propose a future",
