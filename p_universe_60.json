We are now at a stage where it is increasingly possible to create virtual reality experiences that are very similar to those we would normally have to those of a physically disabled person. This is partly because of the advances in computing power, but also because of the way in which our current understanding of the human body has evolved.

Kingston is a World Heritage Site and National Historic Landmark. Owned by the Municipal Municipality of Kingston since 1977, its location on the edge of the North End of Toronto has been a point of pride for the City since its inception. As Canada\u2019s largest city, Kingston has a unique perspective on contemporary art, presenting art that has touched the surface in other cities, such as New York, London, and Glasgow, but has remained largely unseen in Canada. Kingston\u2019s focus on the surface is furthered by its metropolitan orientation, which makes it an ideal location for artists to present their work.  Kingston\u2019s metropolitan orientation has spawned an exciting, local perspective on art that has translated well to the international scene. Artists have taken their live events to the beaches, theatres, historic districts, cultural venues, and historic public spaces of Kingston. Artists have staged workshops, curated public events, and presented their work at the Public Library, Crafts and Industry, the Kingston Biennial of Art, and the Kingston Biennial of Music.

        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial is premised on a foundation that looks to the long-term prospects for the region and the city of Liverpool in particular.  The region has an unusually rich visual arts sector, described by The Guardian as \u2018the most developed arts scene anywhere in Europe\u2019. This is underpinned by a creative city culture, which is rooted in the Liverpool of yore.  The region\u2019s history dates to1828 with a population of under 10,000. During the mining boom of the early 20th century, this area saw off the forces of decline, making this one of the most attractive areas for artists of the time. In the 1950s this artistic production ramped up, with the Ibiza Biennale following the Bond exhibition circuit to Birmingham, Newcastle, Liverpool and London. In the 1970s, the sector noticed a shift in priorities, and began to produce quality works of art in the most iconic locations in the city.  The 1980s saw the return of the Bond Art scene, this time it was led by women artists, the IBA that was focussed on young people, and the International Dada Association, which promoted the work of Dutch and international artists. The 1990s saw the return of the Liverpool Image, this time it was focused on the young and emerging artists. The 2000s saw the return of the Liverpool Image, this time it was focussed on young and emerging artists.  The Next Liverpool Biennial will be inspired by the communities and artists who live, work and play in and around Liverpool. The Biennial will reflect the city\u2019s history, creativity and appetite for new things to show, do and see.  The Biennial will also have",
        "  The Next Liverpool Biennial should then explore the myriad of cultural, social and artistic situations that have arisen over the past forty years in which Liverpool has been a driving force and site of cultural experimentation.

The pedagogical potential of the Next Liverpool Biennial is immeasurably greater than that of any other biennial, European or local, and it promises to be an event of profound symbolic and intellectual importance.
