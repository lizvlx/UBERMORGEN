        "15 years on from the publication of The Fat Orange Trilogy, a collection of interviews with artists, musicians, and critics, convened by Ryszard Stanis\u0142awski at the Authors\u2019 Club, Liverpool, in 1981. Able to quote authors without limit, the curators chose these great interviews to complement the artwork. The resulting quartet, together with the photographic documentation and manuscript, became the core of Fat Orange Press Release. The press release went out into immediate release in many countries, and soon after received a standing ovation in Liverpool. A month later it was signed by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and the Liverpool Art Gallery. Strikingly, no other contemporary art event in the UK had as strong of an impact on the local arts scene as Liverpool had on that of course, but there were other factors too - the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, for instance, who were soon to become established in the region. The Liverpool Biennial then continued its activity in the Liverpool Art Gallery, the Liverpool Museum and the J&M Library. It signed up with more than one festival after that, the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Biennials, the 11th and 12th Biennials, the 15th and 16th Biennials, the 2017 and 2022 Biennials, and the 2023 and 2024 Biennials. At this time the Biennial stops at 12:01 am on Sunday.2017, and works its way up until it finds the tiniest of venues. Find more about the Liverpool Biennial here .

        "1931.10.17.Philips press conference.1931.10.17.The press conference was opened by saying that Liverpool Biennial had been set up by accident. There had been a mistake in the recording. The person who had originally arranged for the biennial had meant to invite photographers, but there were none onhand. So the biennial was inaugurated by saying that Liverpool Biennial was an 'off-the-cuff idea' that developed spontaneously in a squat in Hackney, London, in November 2009. The person who had originally put the concept together was Nic Rapha\u00ebcs, who was at the time working as a film-maker and was researching the history of Liverpool. The idea of having a biennial of contemporary art was borrowed from a conference that had just happened in Hamburg. The conference had originally been about art exhibitions that had taken place in Germany but had to be edited out because of space. The next edition, entitled What do artists make of the freedom to express themselves? was completed by a series of films made specifically for the occasion. Taking place between 1960 and 2015, the material in the series comprises 196 films viewed by 13,744 viewers. In 2017, the programme was expanded to cover all forms of visual art.

        "Krizal Stumph (b. 1967, Soro, India) is a filmmaker living and working in Mumbai, India. He is interested in the public realm and sits as close to the public realm as possible, capturing its vernacular while remaining true to his or her own traditions. \n\tStumph\u2019s piece for MADE UP entitled Till There Was You (2008) documents a typical day at work for a suburban Indian girl. Within the domestic sphere, the film deals with manners and appearance, objectifying women and girls, feeding our patriarchal attitudes towards female bodies. \n\tDalit Plain (b. 1984, Mumbai) is a prominent leader in the protest against the growing intolerance experienced by the Dalit community in India. In her recent projects, Plain documents the direct involvement of the",

Working within a framework of literature, media and cultural transmission, his work explores the political, social and psychological responsibilities of open-ended creative expression. \n\tRecent exhibitions include But No One is Perfect, No One is Pure (Mus\u00e9e d'Ixelles, Belgium, 2012), The Documentary Art Center (Monument TV, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Moscow, Russia, 2012), and Turner Prize Visiting Artist (V&A, London, U.K., 2011-2012).Heinrich Meier (b. 1950, Munich, Germany) uses objects and furnishings to symbolise place, ritual and fact",
        "Krizal Stumph (b. 1958, Gescher, Germany) lives and works in Berlin, Germany. Working in photography, painting and sculpture, with a distinctly art-influenced sensibility, he is concerned, first and foremost, with the democratic and social values \u200b\u200bsubstituted for by contemporary technology. Human-like and facile as virtual reality seems, reality itself is often subverted through cortical prostheses, or manipulations that subvert intentionality itself.  Kazimiero Jotta\u2019s (b.1957, Manila, Philippines) unconventional and at times eccentric practice may at first appear to have little to do with the artist\u2019s chosen medium and more to do with the conceptualisation and execution. His photographs, while gorgeous to look at, quickly morph into",
        "Krizal Stumph (b. 1970, Fort\u00edn de las Flores, Mexico) lives and works in Mexico City. In his own words, the aim of his work is to present \"the total picture in a clear and presentable way, so as to enable the viewer to make an informed choice regarding his/her expectations, interests and resolution of these in relation to society at large.\" \n\tHis experimental and utopian works revolve around the idea of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), small unmanned aircraft used to explore vast distances in search of life or new forms of communication. Such visions are palimpsests as well as fantastical \u2013 the mechanised transport never quite achieves the level of Manfred von Richthofen's (b.1949) hovering diorama of worlds. Lazcano has",
        "Krizal Stumph (b. 1984, Ketanggungan, Indonesia) is a photographer who documents the vivid colours and intense patterns that make up the fabric of the contemporary Indonesian patois. By posing provocative and erasing the images he creates a new cultural record of the country. In his recent series of works Bali Pink (1998-2001) Stumph intentionally invents and destroys new ways of viewing the world. In his selection of images the artist creates a new reality, building worlds hitherto unimaginable \u2013 closed or partitioned, flat or fluid. The Pink Panther\u2019s 52-page book documents his Vietnam Diary (2002). The images in the book are horrific, graphic, and intensely claustrophobic. Yet the oppressive presence of the images \u2013 as well as their emotional impact \u2013 is tempered by a certain dign",

        "Krizal Stumph (b. 1975, Campo Grande, Brazil) immerses his audience in a vast world of animated cartoon characters. The artist, an animator on the rise, takes us beyond the realm of abstract art into a new creative realm filled with life and possibility. Cartoon characters and the sense of humour they inspire are at the heart of a new work for MADE UP entitled Art Of Being Weird (2008). Drawn from her vast body of work, the artist describes how she creates her drawings, the general vibe of her work and the process of drawing each one.  \n\tProcess-Vancouver draws upon both commercial and non-commercial sources to develop her work. Within the context of a rapidly changing art economy, local artists are looking to connect with consumers and engage with their life experiences.",
        "Krizal Stumph (b. 1960, Pematangsiantar, Indonesia) has always been fascinated with the language of photography, its expressive and evanescent qualities. He has a longstanding practice that traces the history of the photographic process from the ancient Greeks to the present, Indonesia being his home country. \n\tThe artists have been working together in similar ways on museum sites in Britain, including at Newcastle\u2019s Victoria Miro Gallery (2001), but their collaboration on Liverpool\u2019s\u2019 Victoria Miro Gallery is different. It is here that they film the piece that will become \u2018The Story\u2019 \u2013 the production does not yet exist \u2013 and release it into the wider world. The artists have named the film after the hero of the 1967 Liverpool march, who was killed in a motorcycle accident. This",
        "Krizal Stumph (b. 1935, Hamilton, United States) lives and works in Detroit, Michigan, USA. Unsurprisingly, the craft of his artistic production is influenced by the themes and concerns of his patients. His conceptual frameworks meditate on cinematic, happenstance-based narratives, in which fractured narratives emerge in unexpected configurations. For MADE UP, he presented a number of \u2018film moments\u2019 that formed part of an exploratory episode, embodying the theme of fractured narratives. Participants\u2019 perceptions of the episode were as important as the actual work, as the \u2018events\u2019 themselves informed our perception of reality. In seeking to capture moments of momentous event, the artist often turns to the memories of his own life, as he reflects on important decisions he makes today. Using a",

With a clear prescription ink jet black background and a subtle gradient applied through a fine brush, the artist applied sculptural meaning to the everyday. He is not interested in the mundane objects and techniques associated with the craft of art: this work transcended convention and",

        "Krizal Stumph (b. 1934, Beichengqu, China) is a photographer who documents the vivid colours of contemporary Chinese life. His pictures are not technically staged, but are more historical reports than true reports of encounters with the real world. He has taken some very daring photographs in places such as Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and India, but they have all ended badly, in heartbreaking accidents \u2013 and often, tragically, suicides. The photographer has two cameras in his hand at all times. In both cameras is a large-format photographic print. This large-format photographic print is wrapped in a tissue paper and placed into a transparent pocket. The photographer never looks at the print itself, but rather at the pockets where the prints have been passed from hand to hand. The resulting photographs are intensely nostalgic, as if we went"
