For a catalogue of the main exhibition and further details on each of the participating artists, please go to www.lewrockwellphotography.com.  The Next Whitney Biennial is the UK\u2019s largest festival of contemporary photography, and one of the most ambitious public art projects to be presented in Europe.  The project reflects the momentum of contemporary art and its globalisation, its public that is increasingly attracted by the aesthetic experiences of contemporary artists rather than the historical studies and studies.  The Next Whitney Biennial blends the cultural and aesthetic experience of the Liverpool region with the artistic and academic perspectives of the present. The curators have embraced this new model as their own, with input from the likes of Bob Geldof, Red Min(e)d, Richard Wilson, Ken Mackenzie, Guy Debord, Noam Chomsky, Noam Bezalel, Yayoi Kusama, Shilpa Dziewior, and many more.  The Next Whitney Biennial is the culmination of a five year engagement that has brought together thirty-seven artists from fifteen countries. The curators have brought their diverse experiences and perspectives to the biennial, including working in conflict zones such as Chechnya, Northern Ireland, and Pakistan, and presenting work that explores political, cultural, physical and emotional experiences from a wide range of cultural perspectives.

        "The Next Whitney Biennial should be seen as the culmination of a three-year project that began with the Manchester Metropolitan University Art Gallery inviting artists from across the continent to consider what might be called \u201cthe next biennial of photography\u201d.  This was not some utopian project; it was based on solid research and presented with some very good critiques.  It was led by a commissioning team made up of artists, scholars and curators, with input from a distinguished panel of experts. The artworks exhibited across the three-year period would have been the subject of a major art exhibition had they not been commissioned for the exhibition.  The Next Whitney Biennial was founded as The Birth of a Suburbia by Adrian Hall, Dean of the Manchester Art Gallery. In 2007, the gallery welcomed Jacq\u00e9l\u00e9 Test\u00e9, then of the Poly/Graphic Arts Research Group, to collaborate on the project. The poly/graphic arts research group conducted the research for Manchester\u2019s Biennial.  The Next Whitney Biennial has since gained a new chair: Diana Topping, Research Fellow at the Poly/Graphic Arts Research Group. This brings the project full circle to the founding of the inaugural Manchester Biennial in 2005.  The Manchester Biennial 2005 was founded as a yearlong exhibition following the recommendation of the Palazzo delle Arto (Photographer & Editor) association, whose members are listed in the following order: Guido, communications director at Palazzo delle Arto, Alessandro, editor at Palazzo delle Arto, Guido, associate editor at Palazzo delle Arto, Franco, trade editor at Palazzo delle Arto.

It is quite clear from the outset that the Next Whitney Biennial will have to offer something new and different in order to claim a place in the hearts and minds of the public.  The Next Whitney Biennial is the culmination of many years of work by a small group of curators (Graphic Designer, Noise Biennale winner and all) to bring Liverpool\u2019s vibrant medieval and modern galleries to life. Their vision is set against the background of Liverpool\u2019s vibrant modern history and local communities, where much of the activity takes place. The Next Whitney Biennial will set out to reveal, interpret and discuss the complex relationship between the past, present and future in order to inspire and engage the community.  In order to make the most of the biennial\u2019s unique setting, the Next Whitney Biennial will have to engage and engage the community in new and unexpected ways. This will have to be done in order to create stimulating and distinctive activities which take place across the city and beyond.  The Next Whitney Biennial is urgently needed if we are to engage contemporary art in the way that contemporary art should be engaged. The biennial should be able to contribute to the conversation and be a driving force for new and innovative discussions in contemporary art.
