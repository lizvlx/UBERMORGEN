        "And should show how art and politics of the city have played a part in reversing the policies of austerity and gentrification.\u201dLaunched by Damien Hirst and Joan Jonas in 1987, the annual event, which is now supported by four hundred organizations and is staged in partnership with the Whitney Biennial Society, was established by a group of curators, activists, and activists in an effort to expose the discursive, structural, and institutional barriers that prevent artists and artists-and-artists from finding new and more accessible outlets for their work.\u201cIn its twenty-five years at the forefront of the fight against austerity, in its ongoing exhibitions and events, and in its creative collaborations with artists, the biennial has become a model for how we as a society can confront and dismantle the existing structures that contribute to and exacerbate inequality,\u201d said Jill Clayton, executive director of the Whitney Biennial Society. \u201cThe next Whitney Biennial will break down barriers through a deep exploration of the ways in which art and politics of the city and the city-region intersects with and unifies with art and politics of the city.\u201dAmong the projects that will be staged during the biennial\u2019s run are \u201cThe Future Is Present,\u201d a collaborative project with artists and activists from West Liverpool; \u201cArt and Politics: Policy and Politics in the City of Liverpool\u201d (August 14\u2013December 21, 2021); \u201cPosterity: Art and Politics,\u201d a project with artists from the West End; and \u201cSecession: Art and Politics in the City of Liverpool\u201d (May 18\u2013June 21, 2022).The biennial will also host a number of concerts,",
        "The Manchester Museum of Art (Manchester) is planning to shutter its doors for six weeks, beginning on October 28, to allow researchers and artists a four-week window to re-create the institution\u2019s original structure, which was badly damaged by a fire at the factory in February. The museum received a $50 million donation from the Leymans family, who run the British luxury goods manufacturer to bolster its building of its new \u00a3450 million headquarters in the city, and is hoping to raise $80 million to rebuild the museum.The museum, which has been closed since March because of the Covid-19 outbreak, expects to be back open by the end of October. In a statement, the museum said: \u201cWe acknowledge the challenges ahead and we are working hard to meet them, but we believe that the future of the museum lies with researchers, practitioners and the public. We will continue to research and experiment with new and different ways of working in our laboratories, with new and different materials and technologies, to deliver fresh ideas and exciting new uses of art. . . . We reserve the right to make further changes to the museum as we progress through the next six weeks.\u201dIn an attempt to mitigate the risk of the Covid-19 outbreak spreading to other venues, the museum will restrict the number of visitors to the museum by limiting the number of visitors allowed to enter the premises at any one time. The institution will also begin evacueeing visitors from its buildings, and will begin training to automatically avoid direct contact with the virus and to limit the number of visitors it attracts.\u201cWe are taking all possible measures to minimise the risk of any exposure to Covid-19,",
        "Juridical Innovation\u2019 is a great term to use here, as in a nutshell, it means that the future of the academy is at stake. The future of the city, the future of the city\u2019s future. All of the pieces are there in the frame.\u201dOne of the first pieces expected to be carried out is a redesign of the museum. It is likely that the museum will be reconfigured to include a new public square, a new exhibition space, and a new work by the curator of contemporary art, C\u00e9cile Aiguille-Nadal, as well as a new collection of contemporary art. The institution will also likely host smaller exhibitions, such as a 'Selection of Contemporary Art from Around the World\u2019s Cultures\u2019 Curated by the Canadian curator, Catherine Chiu.

Schell comes to the institution from the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MoMA), where she has served as the director of collections since 2014. She succeeds Nancy Panetta, who retired in August 2019 after a decade at the helm of the institution.\u201cRina Schell\u2019s record of success as a curator and as a leader of the NMA and the museum makes her the perfect person to lead the museum through this difficult time,\u201d said Mary Anne Carter, chair of the board and director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cWe have had a long-standing partnership between",
        "A true reflection of the city we love.\u201d\u00a0The biennial will also include a selection of new works by ten artists, each of whom has served as the commissioning studio for a major work by an unknown artist. Among the works on display will be work by the late British designer Richard Avedon, whose rich and enigmatic image\u2014created in a small space and conceived as a form\u2014is captured in the full range of its range, from craggy coastal habitats to muggy rainforests. Avedon\u2019s work will also be presented as a work in a series of three exhibitions at the museum in 2021.In a review published in the September 2019 issue of Artforum, Avery Green, editor of the September issue of Artforum, wrote: \u201cIn the early 1990s, the art trade was in its infancy. In the exhibition \u2018Ten at Ten\u2019 at the Museum of Modern Art,\u2019 Avedon and other young British artists such as Peter Sellars, Olafur Eliasson, and David Hockney were invited to join the family of the avant-garde. They responded by inventively combining the avant-garde and their own interests. These early acts of collaboration, which were radical in their own right, were not lost on David Brent, then chairman of the board of trustees of Tate Britain and chair of the Tate\u2019s management committee. In 2001, the Tate appointed Avedon a peer. Avedon is represented by Gagosian.\n\n\nThe Israel Museum in Jerusalem has appointed\u00a0Amira Hass as its new deputy director for exhibitions and collections.

        "The Next Whitney Biennial should provide a platform for those engaged in the contemporary art scene and those who would like to engage it. It should be a place where we can find and present our contemporaries as well as those who have yet to engage us.  The Next Whitney Biennial is the culmination of many years of work and aims to be a significant event in the contemporary art calendar.  The concept for the Next Whitney Biennial was first suggested by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra in 2000. At that point the programme was already well underway and included performances by Damien Hirst, Damien Schiff, Andy Goldsworthy, Mark Wood, Aphex Twin, Aphex Twin & Arne Skaug Olsen.  In 2002, the programme was remade and expanded to a central tenet of the Art Programme. Various artists were invited to present the programme in its various flavours; the core artists were invited to engage with the programme as it were, developing new material and events within the programme. The programme was remade again as Whitney Biennial 2002/2003 and again as Whitney Biennial 2005/2006.  In 2008, the programme was transformed into a triennial for Contemporary Art. A total of ten Biennials took place, of which seven curated by the curators chosen by the artistic director. Of these, six were public exhibitions and four events were forums moderated by Jenny Lord, directed by Bradley M.D.\nBirmingham \u2013 Biennial 2019 The first Biennial of Contemporary Art in Birmingham 2019. The programme was curated by Jenny Lord, followed by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Ali Subotnick. The exhibitions were curated by Dorothee Kelly, based on a four-year project.  In 2010, the",
        "The Biennial should answer the many questions it has raised about how the contemporary artist became a living, breathing thing.   The Next Whitney Biennial was first held in February 2006 and since then each edition was accompanied by a symposium at Liverpool\u2019s Academy of Science, which acted as a go-between for the artists and the public. The introduction of the Next Whitney Biennial was prompted by the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2005 which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more. Liverpool\u2019s Academy of Science was immediately launched as a helpline for the bereaved and injured people affected by the attack. Thereafter, every two years, Liverpool\u2019s Next Whitney Biennial invites artists to exhibit across the city. Liverpool\u2019s Academy of Science is the only institution in Britain to have pre-eminently placed on the world stage the Manchester Arena bombing in 2002.  The first edition of the Next Whitney Biennial, titled \u201cBehind the Ballpark\u201d featured artists such as Andy Goldsworthy, Christian Boltanski, Vito Acconci, Shilpa Gupta, Chris Marker, Ken MacLeod, Rachel Whiteread, Nigel Wallop, Christian Welch, and more.  The 2nd edition of the Next Whitney Biennial, titled \u201cIn Below the Lights\u201d featured artists including Moirika Bari, Sa\u00e2danezade Esposizione, Emile Zile, Bruno Fernandes, Toussaint Ledoux, Anna Hula\u010dov\u00e1, and Jonas \u017dakaitis.  The 3rd edition of the Next Whitney Biennial, The Spectacle of the Ballpark\u201d featured artists such as: Hou Hanru.  4th",
        "It should also offer a view into the future of Liverpool as a vibrant city engaged in the cultural life of the people.  The first edition in 1991 was focused on Liverpool by artist and composer John Peel. The theme Liverpool is derived from the famous song Liverpool Lads by the group Thin Lizzy. The first Whitney Biennial was focused on Liverpool by artist Craig Charles. The exhibition Liverpool 1893 was one of a number of seminal exhibitions in the history of Liverpool organised by The Whitney Biennial Trust. It featured the work of many presenters and curators and was seminal in the development of the Whitney biennial as we know it today.  The exhibition Liverpool 1893 was followed by Liverpool 1900, Liverpool 1947, Liverpool 1949, Liverpool 1955, Liverpool 1960, Liverpool 1967, Liverpool 1971, and The Liverpool Mega. In 1977, the trust completed the event with a three-day event at the Liverpool School of Art. The next three editions were The Liverpool Mega (1985), The Liverpool Mega (1990), and The Liverpool Mega (1995). In 1999, the trust completed the event with a four-day event at Liverpool Sorocaba. The next three editions were Lust For Liverpool (2000), Unmapping The River (2003), and The Momentum Manifesto (2005).  In 2009, the trust completed the event with a three-day event at the Maritime Museum. The next three editions were Liverpool 2018, Liverpool 2019, and The Next Megacity (2007). In 2013, the venue was opened to the public in a new location off Liverpool Road (behind the Liverpool Art Gallery). The next edition was Rewriting The Rules (2009).  In the spring of each year, the museum presents a biannual event exploring the literature and practice",
        "There should be some comment on the progress of the Biennial and its themes.  The biennial should also have an impact on the city\u2019s image in a number of different ways. For example, should it encourage people to visit, live in Liverpool, or take part in the Biennial? Should it annoy them, give them pleasure or make them uncomfortable, it is the community that should bear the brunt of the impact. These are the kinds of impacts that should be felt by those who live in, work in or represent Liverpool. The impact can be felt most strongly in the area around Liverpool, where people live, work and play.  The Next Whitney Biennial should act as a point of departure for the city, and for Liverpool as a whole, in an international context. It should provoke, on a local basis, conversations about Liverpool and art, and encourage the city\u2019s reputation as a centre for artists, arts and culture to be reconsidered.  The Biennial should be of general appeal, and have some impact on the city\u2019s image. The Next Whitney Biennial has a history of doing this, having begun with the Jekyll Island Biennial in 2005. This event brought together artists from across the city, and was successful in tapping into the spirit of Leeds which is evident in many of the artists.  The Next Whitney Biennial has since begun to extend to other cities in the UK and abroad, and is in 2019 at its 10th edition. This event brought together thirty-seven artists from Liverpool, the East Midlands and the Republic of Ireland, and was hugely popular. The programme was divided into three main events: \u201cOpen Spaces\u201d, which featured artists who exclusively worked with"

The resulting objects are elegant and sharp without being over-the-top so much as they perfectly match the decor of their environment. The way in which objects are arranged in the cultural or historical context is a powerful determinant of their identity. For Nishimura the objects were intentionally fragmented, as if he were carrying them with him on a journey. Each object was unique and housed in a unique location. Nothing was the same, of course, and nothing was ever the same place or situation again. But the way",

        "Samiya Nishimura (b. 1985, Laghouat, Algeria) lives and works in Rome. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Algeria became a leading producer and exporter of rubber by the metric system. This meant that rubber trees, the standard ingredient in the manufacture of toilet paper, were also exported to neighbouring countries. The abundance of these exports in the region has since resulted in a surplus of British local product in the streets of Liverpool. This has had a domino effect, spreading across the city and into the streets of the local Wal-Mart. As a result, the quality of the local produce has been compromised and, in some ways, even lost. As a result, the city has lost its status as a centre for rubber goods and is instead remembered as a rendezvous for expats and curious",
        "Serafino Nishimura (b. 1985, Laghouat, Algeria) lives and works in Rome, Italy. In his artistic practice, media designations such as narrator, antagonist, archetypal hero and antic, multiple perspectives are treated as ontogenetic narratives, in which the multiple viewing angles of the artist's body of work all point to the same truth. \n\tFor Whitney Biennial 2016 Nishimura presents Homo Gestalt, a new large-scale single-screen film installation incorporating photographs, diagrams, film and sound. The work focuses on Liverpool\u2019s Margaret Bridge, a structurally sound multi-layered public realm construction. It is presented within the Chinatown episode in Re: Thinking, Talking and Killing (2005), referencing recent court cases involving Chinatown residents and the consequences of immigration on the local economy",
        "Mary-rita Nishimura (b. 1985, Laghouat, Algeria) lives and works in Brussels, Belgium. Nishimura is interested in the art of appropriation, the production of aesthetic goods by taking sides, and the politics of authenticity. She explores these questions within and between art forms and shapes how representations are typically spatially processed, politicised or erased from popular culture.\n \n\tRecent exhibitions include \n\t\n\tThe New Museum, New York, USA (2016); Far Eastern Art Foundation, Bloomington, USA (2016); MOMA, New York, USA (2016); Wayne State Art Museum, Detroit, USA (2014); Detroit Art Center, Michigan, USA (2013); and Walter Phillips Gallery, Detroit, USA (2012).\nLiu Shi-Fen works full-time as",

Nishimura is interested in politics and social processes going back to the formation of national and international economies in the 19th century. She is particularly interested in notions of empire, nationalism, violence and social dynamics. She has a particular interest in post-colonial struggles and anti-imperialist ideologies.\n\tAdriana Varej\u00e3o\u2019s (b.1985, Rio de Janeiro) art practice combines digital photography and video.

        "G\u00fclseven Nishimura (b. 1985, Laghouat, Algeria) lives and works in Brussels, Belgium. He follows a practice that builds, across multiple materials and techniques, a subtle critique of mass media and the mechanisms for sharing knowledge. More broadly, he proposes that the content of art should reflect \"a reality corresponding to our private, psychological and cultural realities\". In his projects he embeds microphones in places where we place value \u2013 in stores, restaurants, offices, shopping malls, train stations, archives and art galleries. These projects create opportunities for people to interact constructively with the products they hold in their possession, even as they question its authenticity. \n\tFor Whitney Biennial 2016 Nishimura has created a microphone, a sort of global currency, whose use he authorised in the artist statement. The microphone is",

He is particularly interested in the films, prints, and documents that are produced when people\u2019tricks\u2019 one another, as opposed to the traditional professions of artists when faced with the necessity of a live performance. In his recent projects, installations and videos, the artist reinvents existing technologies to push the boundaries of real time communication. \n\u0019In the first-floor bar of Bluecoat, Liz Claiborne (b. 1964, Poole, UK) and Francis Marion Tutunjio (b. 1965, Porto, Portugal) have collaborated with their collaborative video and audio installation, \n",

The work is based on the French term \u2018Planet\u2019, used to describe the last place on earth that one might reasonably expect to find the remains of a romantic relationship: \u2018The secret of a happy ending is in the detail, the location and the way in which the relationship is handled\u2019. It continues to speculate on what happens to us when we leave Earth: \u2018Or maybe we just stay put and enjoy the scenery?\u2019 The title of the work,",
        "Gaviota Nishimura (b. 1985, Laghouat, Algeria) lives and works in Glasgow, Scotland. Nishimura is interested in how the surface of the Earth may become a stage for some more intimate and private acts of eclecticism. This is perhaps a natural evolution in a body of work that has consistently addressed the subject of the Earth\u2019s ecological crisis. \n\tFor Touched, Nishimura presented a fresh and innovative perspective on one of the cornerstones of Liverpool\u2019s iconic landscape: the Albert Dock. This massive structure at the foot of the city\u2019s iconic skyline provides a site for hundreds of thousands of people to congregate and enjoy their cultural identity. In order to create this engaging and nerve-racking spectacle, Nishimura constructed a camera inside the structure\u2019s",
        "Wolrad Nishimura (b. 1985, Laghouat, Algeria) lives and works in Berlin, Germany. The work of Nishimura, like that of his contemporaries, explores the political, social and cultural contradictions of the gallery as a whole. He is fascinated by conflicts of ideologies (biological and cultural, racial and religious), and particularly by conflicts of ideas and ideologies that operate in the arena of ideas \u2013 usually covert and unintentional. Contained within these conflicts of narratives is a certain playful appropriation of oppositional thinking, and the unexpected and unforeseen transformation that takes place when oppositional ideologies clash. Often initiated by the artist himself, these conflicts have proved remarkably survivable, with most coming to light during the course of his career as a journalist. Although they have become part of the fabric of modern society, these narratives have",

Nishimura works in installation, sculpture, photography and drawing, often with pseudonyms such as N.I.C.J.O.B. and Paper Diamond. In his recent works emerging from the shell of his previousmuseum-based creations, Nishimura explores the psychological and physical effects of concentration. The sculptural works were prompted by a recurring dream: a woman dressed in black, spied in a compromising position by a dog, is dragged across a room to confront her estranged husband. Within the Japanese artist\u2019s life-cycle, a series of events in the form of events and happenings was constructed around the artist\u2019s solitary, shrine-like existence. In the women\ufffd",
