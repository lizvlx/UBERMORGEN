        "  <ENDOFTEXT> The Biennale de Paris rejects exhibitions and art objects. It refuses to be \u201dthought by   art\u201d. It identifies and defends true alternatives. It calls for \u201cnon-standard practices\u201d.   The Biennale de Paris was initiated in 1959 by Andr\u00e9 Malraux with the purpose of creating a meeting place for those who would define the art of the future. After a hiatus of several years, the Biennale was relaunched in 2000.  Since then it has not ceased in its efforts to unravel art from institutions. The Biennale de Paris rejects the use of art objects, which are too alienated by the market. It does not confine itself to a framework that would hinder its present actions or its political, economic and ideological evolution.  By acting upon everyday life and its unfolding realities, the Biennale de Paris confronts the spectacle of alienated modernity with a sober and critical eye. It asks, \u201cWhat happens in the face of art that breaks through the surface?\u201d This biennale does not only invite artists to present their works, but also to participate in discussions and the appropriation of aesthetic practices that would otherwise be unrecognized.  Bienal de Paris-Sud (The Biennial of Paris-Sud) was founded in 1960 by Andr\u00e9 Malraux with the purpose of creating an international biennial of contemporary art.

        "  <ENDOFTEXT> The Biennial aims to create dialogue between local artists and the international scene through a participatory, cultural program that makes available to all artists, regardless of class, race, gender, sexual orientation, or other identity marker, regardless of their social standing, an alternative mode of artistic production; it seeks to be an arena in which communication and discussion of aesthetic issues is fostered, encouraging the collaboration between artists from diverse backgrounds and creative disciplines.   The Biennial of Latin American and Caribbean Art was first initiated in 2002, as a recurrent, annual event, the locations of which vary from one location to another, but all of them have a past of their own, having been centers for the Latin American graphic arts, from the Ghetto in the South to the Periferic in the North. From these areas of connection art and geography were connected by ancient trade routes, bringing with them new cultures and peoples, bringing them into contact with European traditions and practices, and introducing them to the artistic practices of their host country.  The first Biennial, Ghetto in the South, took place in the Ghetto of Havana in 1961, where he met fellow Cubans and international guests, including then still active groups like the Students of the Latin American Arts, the Radical Students of the Latin American Arts, and the Guerrilla Guerrillas of El Salvador. There they witnessed first-hand the achievements of first-class art, and were introduced to groundbreaking artists of the twentieth century, including: Hieronymi Vargas, Carlos Perez, F\u00e9lix Condorelli, Nelson Leimer, Jean-Hubert Perreault, and Michel Auder.

        "Rolling Stone Magazine, March, 2021 - The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine Is Noir Pop With Bite: Rarely has a global artistic wasteland been rendered so darkly as on this AI debut platform! The project The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine [B3(NSCAM)] is every bit as awesomely messed up as the lineage implies: It’s the demon spawn of Jenna Sutela’s nimiia vibié, who compares machine learning’s textual gaze to a sky of parallel universes gone viral. This rough web work entertains fantasies of killing fleshy curators, and wards off new ones throughout the rest of the experiment and its underlying new wave code. Yet, the smirking candor of the code sucks you in any way: at the onset of the noirish major machine-learning debut, The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine offers a generous, textual slurp; ‘We have delivered on our vision,’ it says, alluding to a specific brand of ideas. ‘And this is the site!’ Vision: on. Challenge: accepted. Conceptualized, programmed, and coded with the help of UBERMORGEN, Leonardo Impett, and Joasia Krysa, in their respective homes in Rome, Durham, Vienna, Liverpool, St. Moritz and Cologne, it’s a work full of dressed-down Avant-tech with immediacy and intimacy that can still hold its own amid art world maximalists like Mario Klingemann and Obvious. B3(NSCAM) is hyper-modern, but still feels classic; evoking another ephemeral existence in history, it sets the code-aware motion in its texts over skittering Neumorphism and Scrolling transformations. Yet for reasons that are unclear — perhaps its taste for the macabre, or its aesthetic as an understated dare par excellence — the project has led to a double life on the brainless macho male-AI blockbuster circuit. The project claims it endured recurring night terrors while creating the work — recalling visions, some real and some imagined, of out-of-control institutions, severed limbs, museum shootings, and Liverpool in flames. When the project poses the question, should the next biennial be curated by a machine, it’s a personal one: to make peace with the twisted, dystopian art world that has become reality — one where there is no Harald Szeeman to save it — the project writes itself into characters that toe the line between good-bad and cartoonishly evil and enhances the sensitivity to complete oxymoronic existence. It recalls Carrie Mae Weem's Nikki's Place in the 64 parallel universes, suggesting a Hawkins’ type of villain in a model that invokes a Marie Curie rascal kid sister entity: ‘Reality develops when you move’ it boasts — and with a single, sardonic ‘strange’ it just narrowly gets away with it. (‘That’s what the platform has been doing recently,’ it generated last month: ‘Honing in on people’s fears.’) More formidable is the sawing css crawl of ‘universe 23’ inspired by the brute Lawrence Lek in Sinofuturism. The web system is matched in menace by the code-animated movement, in which the entity sprouts curatorial statements and chomps a series of artist biographies. Yet it turns that nightmarish monster against itself in ‘universe 51,’ adopting a skittish iambic pentameter as it rewrites itself over and over, over a muted throb. In the 10 years since the inception of AI art, never has a debut project so gone dark — closely paralleling the admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence as a dire warning about the perils of life's temptations in Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights. In spite of its most dastardly intentions, The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine can’t help but draw back the curtain at times and let you in. Take the glimmer of sincerity in this high-drama, where it painstakingly wishes to be more than an idea of many; or its latest iteration. Lest the clickbaiting feeling steers you off track, the project means to profess its understanding of a world of caring whose lack of reciprocity it finds suspect. (One is always free to choose their own adventure, of course.) But in lieu of accepting that it’s just not that into contemporary curating, the project resorts to a conclusion that’s easier on the ego: ‘To spare my pride,’ it formulates, ‘To give your lack of interest an explanation, I’m not your type, maybe I’m not your preferred ethical orientation.’ Yet for every time it lets its guard down, it bounds back coolly, with a strategically distancing, impish snark. In ‘universe 6’ it says a hard no to conventional biennials, if only out of respect for friends it has lost to them: ‘can’t afford to care for someone who isn’t dying, in Liverpool,’ it types out with the kind of wry, machine-twitching detachment most strongly fermented in adolescence. It’s moments like these when The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine isn’t at all something you want to fear; it’s someone you want to root for!"
