        "The proposed two-day event, which will take place at the Whitney Biennial Centre between August 7 and August 10, 2019, will deliver a biennial that will engage with the history of the city, the city region, and the wider region of Liverpool, and will feature works by a mix of contemporary artists and internationally acclaimed contemporary artists and artists from the region and beyond.The exhibition will be curated by Richard Ray, director of the Biennial Centre; Barbara Bennett, curator and vice president of the Whitney Biennial Foundation; and Kamila Al-Nawaf, director of the Institute for Contemporary Art in the City of Liverpool.\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art (the museum) in New York has revealed new plans to modernize its Public Art Fund, which was launched in 1975 to encourage the acquisition of works by local and national artists and has since become one of the largest supporters of new art. As outlined in a memorandum released today, the museum will raise $2.6 billion for the fund in the 2020 fiscal year, an increase of $900 million from the previous year.\u201cWith a change in the US political climate, and with a renewed sense of purpose, we have decided to make the Public Art Fund a year-round, sustainable model for the arts,\u201d said Leslie Albright, director of the museum. \u201cThe funding for the Public Art Fund will be increased by $600 million for fiscal 2021 to $4 billion. This reflects a recognition of the critical role artists play in the local, regional, and national economies of many cities across the country.\u201d \u00a0Since the fund was established by the Alexander and Frances Stern Foundation, the amount that has been raised has helped more than",
        "At the time of the 9/11 attacks.\u201cWe must engage with the experiences and ways of people from across the globe,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, chair of the exhibition\u2019s curatorial team. \u201cThese are fraught and sensitive times. We are committed to a dialogue with people, people of all backgrounds, of all political persuasions, and of all backgrounds. The internationally recognized 'next best thing',\u201d he added, \u201ceven when it distorts the very idea of the future.\u201dA film by artist Banksy and entitled\u00a0Psychopathia\u2019s Dilemma, which was exhibited at the Biennale of Sydney in 2009 and is currently on view in the museum until September 28, 2019, will also be presented in conceptually themed \u201cThe Museum of the Future.\u201d \u00a0Art critic Philip Kennic wrote in the Guardian last month: \u201cDirk Brittenham, MCA\u2019s director, said that the exhibition \u2018will ask whether art history is made in the future and how art historians and art historians are influenced by the past.\u201d The exhibition will also explore the legacy of the German artist Oswald Kiefer\u0097a central figure in the postwar generation of postwar artists who was a member of a group that included Heinrich Heine, Ernst Liszt, and Wolfgang Schell, among others\u0097and will feature the work of thirty-two artists of the vernacular who are represented in the show.Brittenham told the Art Newspaper that the themes for the exhibition were based on themes from Kiefer\u2019s catalogues, which are currently on view in the exhibition, and that the show \u201cwill demonstrate",
        "Where it is a significant question whether the categories themselves are being policed.\u00a0\n\nIn a move that many thought was desperate, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MoCA) in Los Angeles has announced that it is planning on closing its doors\u00a0in March 2020. \u201cThe closure of MoCA is a necessary and urgent step in protecting the important artworks and collections of the museum, including Toni Morrison\u2019s iconic Art of the Party,\u201d director Dan H. Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe are making the announcement to our staff, our patrons, and the thousands of artists, intellectuals, writers, and activists who have made the museum useful to us and to the world.\u201dThe announcement came after months of protests over the institution\u2019s holdings of a number of controversial works, including a new exhibition dedicated to Ralph Ellison\u2019s \u201cThe Surrealists\u201d and a controversial six-thousand-year-old collection of Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s works. The museum is also facing a class-action lawsuit by art workers who claimed their wages were lowered because of a staffing shortage.In an attempt to placate workers, the museum has committed to increasing the pay of middle-level staffers by 20 percent and creating new financial support packages for artists and small-art museum workers. While the majority of workers were pleased with the changes, they expressed frustration at how little was being done to address wage theft. \u201cWe were promised good news, and this promised to be good news, but it was empty talk,\u201d one worker told the Art Newspaper. \u201cWe are not giving up. We are not giving in. We are fighting to the very last day",

Its inaugural exhibition, \u201cThe Future is Not What It Used To Be,\u201d was curated by John Akomfrah and moved to London\u2019s Barbican Centre in March 2020, shortly after the UK voted to leave the European Union.\n\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City has appointed Wayne Newton as its new deputy director. Newton will be responsible for overseeing the museum\u2019s long-term strategic plan, which aims to expand its collection and research and provide more opportunities for engagement with contemporary art, and will assume his post in July.In his new role, Newton is responsible for ensuring MoMA\u2019s collection remains fully operational during the six-year transition period between its reinstallation of a new director and its reopening in 2021.\u00a0\u201cWhen we began our strategic plan for MoMA in 2021, we knew the next director would need to be able to effectively manage our new master and continue to serve as an advocate for the institution in the years to come,\u201d said\u00a0MoMA director Michael Rosenberg in a statement. \u201cWayne has done a remarkable job guiding MoMA through this difficult time, and I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll continue to shape and inspire the visionary North American art landscape during this challenging period.\u201dPrior to joining the museum, Newton served as a consultant for the nonprofit Pacific Standard Time, which collaborates with the artist-run nonprofit space the Pacific Standard Time Foundation to provide support and resources to artists and"

        "Mcdougle Imm (b. 1978, Erlanger, United States) is a photographer based in Los Angeles, USA. Moved by the city\u2019s rich and complex past, and haunted by the present, Imm finds himself caught between the intrusions and invasions of the present and after. His work confronts what he terms \u2018the living\u2019: architecture, town planning, town house developments, manufacturing plans, waste disposal plans, and the post-industrial future of the city\u2019. In his recent projects he\u2019s made images that are at once humorous and sinister, creating imaginary scenarios where architects, town planners, building societies and other interested parties re-invent the city as they see fit. Imm presents his photographs in the context of a \u2018real\u2019 city, one that is",
        "Kassim Imm (b. 1978, Querecotillo, Peru) vocally expresses the desire for her art to embody in tangible form the tortured, sexually transmitted, and destructive power of the media we consume \u2013 be it rock music, pop culture, advertising or video games. In a provocative and artist-led project to date, Imm writes manifestos (spontaneous as well as controlled) that she distills from her life as a transsexual in Los Angeles and San Francisco, US, into a clear, powerful statement of her artistic convictions. The project, Tentacruz, translates the stigmatic and restrictive power of the male body into a fashion statement that is both feminine and masculine, fashionable and extreme. Within the Roma community in Mexico, the restrictive definition of a man is not only a physical one, but",
        "Adelajde Imm (b. 1978, Isn\u0101, Egypt) takes the street and, in the tradition of the \u201860s counterculture, she organises street events. Her ephemeral projects \u2013 which often center around photography \u2013 temporarily write the history of the city into the fabric of history as an act of political protest. In her series of Elegant Communities (1998), Imm established a photographic archive with \nimmersed objects in her practices that she calls \u2018documentary archeology\u2019. The series entailed the immersing her participants in a series of 'love raids' with men who advertised in the local jewellery trade. These \u2018archaeological raids\u2019 established the men as archetypal warriors rather than mere traders; their stories informed the style of the subsequent",
        "Daleyah Imm (b. 1978, B\u0101zpur, India) believes that through conversation we can all emerge victorious from the disguise of secrecy and regulate ourselves in a world governed by reason.  The headscarf is the crowning glory of this political correctness gone mad, and its advocates (including me) have long ago abandoned the diplomatic dance of compromise to promote their radical agenda. Die-cast textile garments, perfumed with flowers or incense, have always conjured images of religious ecstasy or mystical transformation. But the reality of these vapours is far more cynical, because they signal the consistent stylistic licence of the most banal of our gestures \u2013 the boarding school education of the child\u2019s \u2018friends\u2019.

        "Aldyth Imm (b. 1978, \u0160iauliai, Lithuania) combines artistic practice with research into the history of memory and the poetics of textual artefacts. She is concerned, first and foremost, with the fictive and the real, and the multiple meanings ascribed to words and images. My Struggle (2002) documented the artist\u2019s shifting vocabulary and the ways in which life and memory are configured in both contemporary and historical representations of the Holocaust. In reflecting on contemporary events, Aldyth Imm brings forth the question as to whether the concept of memory itself is itself a construct. If so, the way in which we move and organise ourselves in the present can have lasting repercussions, both external and internal. \n\tRecent exhibitions include Schrin Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, Germany (2017); Palais",

In his work for MADE UP, Imm used the site of his previous two-day show, SCHEDULE (2008), as his working space. In his conceptual work SCHEDULE (2008), Imm proposed a new spatial and temporal structure for the future of \u2018Schedule 1\u2019: the present.

The central character of Imm is a homeless person who goes by the nom de guerre of\u2026\n\tPerfume Genius (2017), Shilpa Rio & iPad (2017), and Channel Orange (2016). Imm began making art during her time as a teenager in Philadelphia\u2019s Art Center, graduating in 2004 with an art degree and a major in stenography. Since then, she has concentrated her activity on writing, engaging with local and national issues, and creating innovative nontraditional art programs.  \n\tShilpa Rio and iPad were developed with art students from Liverpool Transforming Perspective (BIT) in mind. They are innovative projects exploring the territory between fact and fiction, technology",
        "Malaysha Imm (b. 1978, Debila, Algeria) lives and works in Los Angeles, USA. The work of Imm is at once personal and cultural, controversial and spiritual. It is often argued that the term \u2018political correctness\u2019 is too narrow an umbrella, and that constructivism\u2019s solution to the problem of cultural intolerance should be an open, multi-disciplinary dialogue that embraces all viewpoints, including cultural intolerance. In her recent solo exhibition at Victoria Miro, Imm expanded her vision of \u2018political correctness\u2019 to include a theory of cultural censorship developed through the collaboration of three different artists: political scientist Dr. Cornel West; philosopher and writer Noam Chomsky; and literary theorist and evolutionary theorist Noam Finkelstein. The theory of cultural censorship proposed by Imm is that of a",

Using artistic, political, scientific, and museological histories to uncover and propose potential futures, Imm conveys the degree to which visual art and negative cliches simultaneously enter into our contemporary cultural consciousness: whether through epidemic fictions such as Zika or environmental disaster images such as those of the Deepwater Horizon explosion. \n\tMany artists work in collaboration with different people or organizations on different levels of production: at home, in the artist\u2019s gallery, or in some cases, on display in the international discotheque.

In these works, rhythm and blues guitar heroes are transformed into colourful pop songwriters. As well as referencing historic beliefs in terrifying supernatural forces, the works reference a hip-hop aesthetic that blends pop, rock and electronic music genres.\n\tMark Leckey (b. 1971, London, UK) lives in London.

His work points to the undercurrents of superficial, if not downright vulgarity in our society. By posing provocative and subversive functions in our society, Imm aims to highlight the violence and ulterior motives often hidden from our view. In his work for MADE UP, recently presented at the Walker Art Gallery, Imm transformed the interior of a dilapidated dilapidated church into a photography workshop. The decaying structure became a provocation for ideas \u2013 and images \u2013 of the bizarre and dystopian. Within an antiquarian bookcase positioned between two sculptures of religious significance, held together by a binder composed of fine gold leaf and medical instruments, we encountered a battered old photo album",
        "Rosemma Imm (b. 1978, Tal\u2019menka, Russia) is an irreverent polemic that pits eight female Russian artists against one another. The project derives from the artist\u2019s reflections on the socio-political situation in the Russian Federation and internationally. Schinberg and Radchenko\u2019s work is a humorous rendering of the complicated relationship between the artist and her female counterparts. By implication, the artists imply that their art should be similarly interpreted by the male gaze. However, in real life the artists do not limit themselves to depicting male fantasies; they actively explore and confront the resulting je ne sais quoi, refusing to sit back and enjoy the show. The artists remind us in their artwork that despite the best intentions, our behaviour as humans is still profoundly shaped by culture and social structure.",
        "Gonzalez-cintron Imm (b. 1978, Mekele, Ethiopia) aims to redefine traditional art forms through the lens of technology. Through simple installations and appropriated media, the artist brings together various technologies to create socially and politically relevant alterations to prevailing conceptions of image and image forming. In his work with video, the artist creates socially and politically relevant still and moving images that are created not by chance nor by slippage, but on purpose. By using creatively simplistic and transparent methods, he avoids the simplistic and technical issues that plague most post-modern approaches and instead focuses on the emotion and meaning behind the simple configurations. In his work with video, the artist creates socially and politically relevant still and moving images that are created not by chance nor by slippage, but on purpose.

        "Arthur P O'Brien, Chief Curator The Whitney Biennial was founded in 2001 on the basis of the premise that art could be a barometer of social, cultural and political change; that is, could art be a barometer of social, cultural and political change that is pertinent to the contemporary world? The biennial has since instilled itself firmly in the contemporary art world, and has developed a range of educational programmes and public activities in the process.  It is the belief that the Whitney Biennial has become an essential event of contemporary art that has resulted in Liverpool emerging as a leading site for the contemporary art world. The Whitney Biennial has become an important juncture in the development of a mutually beneficial relationship between Liverpool and the rest of the world, and the artist and the wider community.  The Whitney Biennial has become a broad, local event, involving artists, groups of artists, professionals, trustees, community groups and the public. Liverpool has an unusually rich visual arts sector, described by The Guardian as the \u2018most developed arts sector in Europe\u2019.  The Whitney Biennial has become a focus for artistic production and innovation, with new commissions, exhibitions, art collections, exhibitions and education projects. Liverpool\u2019s reputation as a city of artists and creative people, as well as for progressive transport and public facilities, have made the biennial a popular event.  The Whitney Biennial has established collaborative links with the city\u2019s museums and galleries, and the biennial has taken artists and curators to new locales: Whitney Biennial in 2013, Whitney Biennial in 2015, Whitney Biennial in 2017 and the inaugural Whitney Biennial in 2019.  The 1st Whitney Biennial,",
        "Aims and Objectives, recognition of a 'bienal de Liverpool\u2019s diversity, its geographical and textual multiplicity, as well as its status as one of the oldest art forms in the world, demands an active exploration of its future.

It also includes a wide range of programs and events, ranging from summer music and art walks to year-round public art and educational programs. Source: www.biennial.com  <ENDOFTEXT> The International Association of the Biennial of International Art (BIAB) was born during the years 2000 and 2002 in St. Petersburg, Russia. The idea of the Biennial emerged from the mutual interest of artists and collectors who were searching for intercontinental exchanges of contemporary art during the early 2000s. At that time there weren\ufffdt any exchanges planned between Russia and abroad, and the majority of participants were from the Russian Federation. The Biennial caught the eye",
