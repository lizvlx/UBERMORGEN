Not only has his work evolved since his youth into shooting primarily in film and now into digital media, but so has his work generally. His work increasingly has the force of visual narrative, and in recent works he has even appeared as himself in stills taken from images on film. Although Melian and his collaborators at GRIND have often focused on very specific sites and temporal contexts, they have continued to photograph the city as a whole, and its varied inhabitants. Their recent series Mohn Mohn Ming (2017) further explored this interesting relationship between photography and the urban space. \n\tIndeed, the artists\u2019 participation with MANKIND clearly informed",

She has also used her art as a means to raise public awareness and debate and to provide opportunities for social interaction. In the 1960s, Quadin\u2019s drawing was at its zenith. With an intensity never before associated with her, she painted landscapes, buildings and monuments in shades of bright green, transforming urban sprawl into painterly labyrinths of data.

With characteristic self-parody, Suhani deconstructs traditional representations of gender, race, war, environmental destruction, farming and so on, presenting concrete evidence of a changing world.
