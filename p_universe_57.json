R.E., the actor Kevin Spacey, and the malt-wholeer Jack Harrison.Ed Moses, a British painter and sculptor best known for his paintings of Southern plantation life, is known for creating works that deal with the human predicament through a constellation of symbolic and often surreal materials, including plants, animals, and drawings.

It is out of this background that the Next Whitney Biennial is created, and the curators are invited to go out into the world and engage with people. The programme is content and driven by ideas. The Next Whitney Biennial is not limited to art. Ideas are embedded in everything we do. We collaborate on a range of activities to enhance the experience of going to the pub, from arts and cultural events to bespoke events for professionals. And we actively shape the future of art and culture by inviting the likes of Terry Teach, Ma\u0142gorzata Grynska, Jakub Julian Ziolkowski, Jan Hoet, Czeslaw Milos, and the Wroc\u0142aw Biennale has already helped to shape the image of Wroc\u0142aw and Wroc\u0142aw in new interesting ways.

The D-0 ADAPTIVE organization was created in 1955 by the Coll\u00e8ge de Monaco. Its mission is to organize and promote contemporary art of a high quality, to disseminate the work of art and to facilitate its publication.  D-0 ADAPTIVE was created by the Coll\u00e8ge de Monaco in 1955 to serve as the main post-war exhibition for French art in North America. The idea of establishing an international art biennial in Canada was inspired by the success of the Coll\u00e8ge de Rennes/Am\u00e9rique Internationale de Monaco (1954). There were, at that time, very limited options for art biennials in Quebec. At that time, the opportunity presented itself to create an international art event with the cooperation of the Government of Quebec and the Municipality of Montreal.  D-0 ADAPTIVE was first held in August 1955 with a three-month exposition at the Coll\u00e8ge de Monaco. The exposition was titled D-0 : International Art Contemporain de Montr\u00e9al.  Twenty years later, in August 1961, the first edition of the Biennale was held in Canada.
