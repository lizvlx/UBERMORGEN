        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial should be back in force and your place at Homebaked needs to be put at the forefront of set up discussions so that the town can reclaim and reinvent its identity, career choice and multiple interestingly eclectic set of recipes, personalities and venues. The Next Liverpool Biennial brings Liverpool one step closer to its potential and we are excited about what it can offer.  Next Liverpool Biennial: The Story So Far Next has set out to tell the story of how Liverpool came to be where it is today, what drew people to the city and what role local artists played in creating Liverpool\u2019s distinctive look and feel. The story so far reveals how Liverpool came to be where it is today, what drew people to the city and what role local artists played in creating Liverpool\u2019s distinctive look and feel. The Biennial looks at the many paths taken by Liverpool through out history and explores the many different ways that Liverpool has contributed to the world and to ourselves. Liverpool has a fascinating history and I am fascinated by what lies behind the fa\u00e7ade.  The first incarnation of Liverpool Biennial was The Liverpool Biennial in 1996. This inaugural event saw over 240 artists participate with works exhibited across the city and surrounding area. The 1st edition was curated by Susanne Gaensheimer & Vandana Reker, followed by a three-month internship programme giving artists and curators six months to explore the themes of the event.  The 2nd edition of the Liverpool Biennial in 2008 saw a three-month temporary hiatus following the death of Susanne Gaensheimer and the subsequent appointment of Richard Wilson as Director of the Centre for Contemporary Art. The exhibition was re-curated by Susanne Gaensheimer &",

The festival presents the work of international artists, from the acclaimed galleries in Liverpool and around the world, and is Europe\u2019s largest festival for contemporary art. The festival draws on Liverpool\u2019s rich history as the home of Liverpool Shell\u2019s Children\u2019 exhibition and the hugely influential Children\u2019 Art Centre.  Founded in 1998, Liverpool Biennial has established itself as a significant event on the international arts calendar.

        "   Liverpool Biennial Development Panel  The Liverpool Biennial Development Panel (LDCP) is the UK\u2019s leading body for public engagement into the making of art and other cultural developments. The purpose of the LDP is to provide both local and international audiences with something new and different to engage with, think and debate, and to play a role in shaping the future of Liverpool.  The LDP was founded in 2001 on the belief that art and creativity are essential to the contemporary picture of Liverpool. It has done so because of our location which, in recent years, has been an important point of focus for the creative industries in the town. The Centrepiece of LDP is the Town Art Gallery which, in the past decade, has become a truly important landmark in the town. It has produced major programmes including The Liverpool 2026: Exhibition and the Liverpool 2029: Biennial. The Gallery also has a museum which, alongside the gallery, houses a collection of other significant collections. \u2018The Liverpool Biennial: A Century of Art in the Pubs\u2019, the first Biennial in the town, explored the pioneering social, political and artistic movements that have shaped the cultural landscape of the region.  The LDP has a permanent exhibition space covering the entire width and height of Liverpool city. This includes the iconic Public Image Gallery, the Music and Audio gallery, the Science and Technology gallery, the Public Art gallery, and the LGBT+ art gallery. In addition, the geographical and historical holdings in the Liverpool city area give the Biennial a unique perspective, offering a history of art and culture that is both engrained in the local traditions and introducing Liverpool to the world of contemporary art.  The Biennial is patronised"

        " \"Over the past few years the global art market has greatly increased its strategically directed or ideational perspective threatening rather than enabling most new markets. While commodity values are always going to be a part of conventional economic measures (which are also the political sector leans towards ever more), the focus should be no longer solely on the manufactured but biennially constructed commodity value amounting to an increasingly rich museum parcel for self indulgently antiquated lesser art projects.  The market should no longer capture the narrative focus, approaching yet still lower middle-classes communities orchestrating market reform through information yield (leveraging and on the buyout market) rather than the mostly learned metainformation delivering autonomy from drawbridles and bureaucracies of rhetoric, financing and willing memberships that network in older urban compact.

        ".\u00a0The future of Liverpool needs to be taken seriously by a large and influential group of international researchers and not just a few passionate souls.\u00a0I wish you, and all the curators who have made it possible, all the best.\u00a0Sincerely,\u00a0John Aldridge\u00a0Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA)In an email sent to the MCA\u2019s committee on Monday, the organization\u2019s executive board chair Jane Lehner wrote \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big challenge. At this stage, we don\u2019t know what the future holds and what the challenges are. We\u2019re taking this challenge seriously and with great care.\u201dThe letter continued: \u201cAs art historians, we need to be objective and listen carefully to the evidence, but we must also not try to change history\u2014that would be to miss the point entirely. We must focus on how to make the most from this extraordinary and unique collection.\u201dThe letter ends with a promise of new partnerships that will help the MCA continue to present exhibitions of work by international artists and will encourage the MCA\u2019s curators to work together in support of the local community. One of the organizations that will offer financial support to the MCA\u2019s curators in support of their work is the Liverpool Biennial Fund (LBFC), which is raising funds to support the artwork of\u00a0Misha Green,\u00a0Sara Horner, and\u00a0Ondine Abodi; and\u00a0Parsen Gallery, which will donate works by artists such as Eva Langret, Nicholas Prouvost, and Brian Plummer.\n\n\nThe Solomon R.

The junta is a Pan-European organization comprised of twenty-six Italian, twenty-three French, and twenty-three Spanish artists that polices the exhibition, design, and exhibition space.Latella\u2019s work, which was made into a series of lithographs which were mounted in a single large, glass-enclosed room, first appeared in an early Artforum\u00a0issue in 1958. Latella was invited to join the junta, but declined. He has since taught at the Montsevo Art Museum in Venice, the Turin Academy of Fine Arts, the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma, and the University of Bologna. Latella\u2019s work will be included in the junta\u2019s fourth edition, which opens in Rome in October.\u201cDesign is the art of past, present, and future,\u201d said Latella. \u201cThe junta is interested in constructing new realities, in the construction of new ways of looking at the world. What we\u2019ve been doing for a long time is to re-create, to re-shape, and to re-examine the internal structure of objects, to re-render the past. It\u2019s important for us to avoid these pre-determined forms and to boldly experiment, a bold spirit in the art world, a new kind of competition.\u201dLatella\u2019s new exhibition space will be inaugurated with \ufffd",
        ".At the same time, as part of the revitalisation of Liverpool, the city must make greater use of its existing cultural and historic sites in an effort to create new opportunities for local people to engage with those sites.

The show, which was curated by Jones in collaboration with Nari Ward-Adams, is concerned with the legacy of artists such as Alberts, Beck, Alton Williams, and Addison Hill, among others, and will highlight the contributions of forty-eight artists to the museum\u2019s collection over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\u201cThis will be a momentous occasion for the community of Los Angeles to celebrate the contributions of twenty-two artists of African descent,\u201d said museum director Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rez-Monroy in a statement. \u201cThese artists will be the subjects of a new exhibition, \u2018African Americans: A Century of Art,\u2019 and the first public exhibition dedicated to them will open at the Museum of Contemporary Art in 2021.
