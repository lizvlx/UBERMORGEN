        "Free View in iTunes\n\nLincoln Center Theater, the New York institution known for its ambitious and bold curatorial projects and its dedication to celebrating the creative and the experimental, has announced that it will remove more than two hundred paintings, sculptures, photographs, and works by legendary New York dealer Robert Irwin. The works, which were often overlooked and poorly presented, often went unrecorded, and many of the artists in the collection were not even aware of their own significance.The Carson-based nonprofit theater collective Plays With Fire was informed by a member of the collection that a new exhibition, \u201cRobert Irwin: Art of Obsession,\u201d will open on September 10. The show includes 180 works by the known, including \u201cIn a Time of Change\u201d (2007) and \u201cIn a Time of Change II: The Past as Present\u201d (2012), both for which the artist made no attempt to hide the exhibitions political and social critique.The announcement follows a year-long campaign to raise funds and awareness for Plays With Fire. The $50,000 reward that was offered for the return of a Robert Irwin painting in 2015 was quickly surpassed by an online fundraiser. The group raised more than $125,000 for the performance, which is currently being hosted at the National City College in Philadelphia.The organization is also seeking the publics help in identifying and insuring the artworks in the collection. The organization has created an online tool that can be used to quickly search for works in the collection, and a website that can be used to track donations.Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the works is urged to call the Narmada Center for Contemporary Art at the University of Colorado at Boulder",

In 2017, the organisation was headed by commissioner Cherif Reiskinck. The first phase of the plan is accomplished by turning the Sorachi Resort into an incubator for new art initiatives and local artists. The resort will play a crucial role in this process by fostering and supporting artists who wish to pursue their artistic ambitions in the public realm.  The second phase of the plan is to create a platform for artists to express themselves in public space. This can be done in many ways. The most obvious way is through a program of art exhibitions or events on top of the Sorachi Tourist Area. This will allow artists to show their work in public places, engage with the audience, and show the city of Algiers in front of an international audience.  The organization can also collaborate with other institutions and organizations, such as the Government of Algeria, the Municipality of Algiers, the Art Foundation of Algiers, and the University of Algiers, to create events or networks linking local to international art scenes. This will give Algiers a platform to show off its artistic fruits.
