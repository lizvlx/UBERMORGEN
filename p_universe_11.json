        "Manroop Senko (b. 1928, Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands) was a painter whose work continued to occupy various conceptual or mythological planes during the last half-century. His abstract and collage\u2010like compositions, which often contain \u2018ghostly\u2019 presences, are characterised by the visualization of moments in concrete reality and the possibility of uncanny detection. If these moments are used to address specific individuals or groups, they can include not only a morbid identification with a past life, but also a fascination with present realities, suppressed or suppressed emotions and psychic states. These images can be loaded either as visions or as hindsight\u2013ing directness. The images inevitably end up in the stories themselves, and the stories centre on individuals or groups who began to emerge from the collective unconscious. Whether it is as the result",

From the late 1970s until his solo exhibitions in the early 1980s, Shulte was a leading figure in the New Generation Art Movement (1999-2006). His highly incisive and sophisticated artworks combine an inventive use of technology with social commentary, historical obliqueness and a deliberate refusal to fit into conventional modes of narrative presentation. He is known for creating avatars that simultaneously inhabit the virtual and physical worlds, and presents an art project made for each persona, complete with problematic conventions and associations.

In an attempt to minimize the impact on local communities, the city removed the statue in 2015. In an attempt to minimize the impact on the Austin Police Department (APD), the work was moved to a secure location in the museum for future display.The removal of the work was made in the interest of protecting the integrity of the investigation, the integrity of the trial, and the integrity of the conviction, the city\u2019s attorney general, Bill Carranza, said in a statement. \u201cThe museum\u2019s supporters, including the city of",

        "The concept of the Liverpool Biennial was first suggested by Adrian Hall, director of Liverpool Biennial 2001. Hall had been commissioned to produce the Liverpool Biennial of International Art in 2005 but was not involved in the planning of the event when it took place. He suggested the event as a social event for artists, for members of the public and for businesses. Liverpool Biennial 2001 received a mixed response from art professionals and arts organisations but has since become the most acclaimed biennial in the UK. Liverpool Biennial 2001 has also received international recognition, the M.E.N.A.T.E. Award for Contemporary Art from the Bahrain Independent listed it as one of the 100 most influential art events in Bahrain in 2005.  In September 2007, the Bahraini Ministry of Culture launched the 1st Bahrain Biennial in support of the country\u2019s cultural development. The aim of the event was to promote Bahraini contemporary art and to show the diversity of styles and creativity within the Gulf Cooperation region. The Ministry explained that the Bahraini Arts Commissioning Committee is in a non-profit capacity and that the Bahraini Media Development Authority is its sponsor. The 1st Bahrain Biennial was attended by the Ministry of Culture, the Bahraini Ministry of Culture, the Bahraini Musawari Rumi Cultural Center, and Bahraini Tourist Commission.  The 2nd Bahrain Biennial was held in October 2011. The 3rd was held in February 2013. The Bahraini Ministry of Culture has been elected to handle the media development and the Bahraini Arts Commissioning Committee is in a non-profit capacity. The Bahraini Media Development Authority functions similarly to a public sector corporation in Bahrain, except that its funding is based on the royalties from books",
        "The concept of the \u2018Next Liverpool Biennial\u2019 was first suggested by the Liverpool Philharmonic in 1977, who suggested a similar event every five years in the tradition of the Liverpool Jazz Festival. Since that time, numerous publications have suggested the concept, including: Liverpool Biennial: The Sound and the Behaviour of Art 1979, Review of Art in 1979, Review of Art in 1980, Review of Art in 1985, and Liverpool Biennial: Attraction and Repulsion 1979.  In recent years the Biennial has also received a public lecture tour and a multimedia presentation. The last was Liverpool Biennial: The Past and Present 1987. The exhibition was followed by a series of three films: Liverpool 10,000 Lives 1989, 10,000 Stars 1992, and 12,000 Faces 1995. The last was Liverpool 10,000 Arts 1999.  The 11th edition of the Liverpool Biennial: The Triennial of Australian Contemporary Art in 2003, The Liverpool Biennial: Australia & New Zealand 1999 and The Liverpool Biennial: Europe 2000 were commissioned for New Zealand. The 2003 and 2009 Liverpool Biennials were the first to use the trans-Pacific voyages to explore contemporary art. The 2011 Biennial explored the present and future of art in Liverpool.  The 12th edition of the Liverpool Biennial: Acts of Faith 2015, includes a focus on contemporary art from Australia and the UK. The 11th edition focused on Australian art in 2006.  The 12th edition of the Liverpool Biennial: Fruits of the Spirit 1990, focuses on the living tradition of Christianity. The 10th edition, Spirituality 1990, included a focus on contemporary art from England and Wales.  The 13th edition of the Liverpool Biennial",
        "The Next Liverpool Biennial will engage Liverpool as a city of culture and showcase the best contemporary visual art from around the world. The opportunity to showcase major new works by international artists and tribes is there, but the focus will be on the people behind the art. The people behind the art will be revealed through interviews, events and projects that follow.  The People & Project gallery in Liverpool housed the Liverpool Biennial 2001 and 2003. Since 2007, the People & Project gallery has been used to showcase the work of international artists and tribes. More than 600 works of art and more than 1000 murals and sculptures have been created by Liverpool\u2019s artists and tribes since the first Liverpool Biennial in 2001.  The first Liverpool Biennial in 1991 focused on painting, with works reflecting the colour of the skin and the city of Liverpool. Since the 4th Liverpool Biennial in 1997, all colour work has been colour timed and timed again, in order to reflect the different histories and cultures of the city. The 5th Biennial in 2001 focused on art in public space, with works timed to coincide with major events in the city.  In 2013, the People & Project moved to a new location \u2013 the Bowerside Art Gallery, a museum known for their collections of British Art. This new location has made a huge impression on the museum, with many new works appearing in their exhibition and on the internet, in conjunction with the Liverpool Biennial Events calendar.  The 6th Liverpool Biennial in 2015 focused on art in public space 2.0, with works timed to coincide with major events in the city. The 8th Biennial in 2017 focussed on art in public space 3.0, with works timed to coincide with International",
        "The Next Liverpool Biennial will act as a moving image event, with works and projects moved around the city, displayed in public spaces and in buildings. This is in sharp contrast to traditional biennials, where the focus was on the artworks themselves, their public presentation and the events that surrounded them. The Next Liverpool Biennial will be aware of the history of Liverpool and its surrounding area, and it will explore how the local context and its contemporary artistic vision can be utilised to the fullest extent.
