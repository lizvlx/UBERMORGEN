        "Gearold Owusu (b. 1948, Schweizer-Reneke, South Africa) is a South African artist working in photography, illustration, video and printmaking. With an inventive cross-cultural approach, his work explores how language shapes our ability to relate to each other and to imagine other minds. Continuing his exploration into South African and British cinema, his inventive new work incorporates the techniques of documentary and fiction \u2013 telling stories of everyday life in both countries \u2013 whilst also addressing pressing political issues of the day. The new work is inspired by South African and British Documentary Film Arts, and features an African South African Setting and a British Story. The narratives, grounded in fact and often moving freely between reality and fiction, address fundamental \u2013 and often neglected \u2013 issues of cultural authenticity and representation. \n\tFor Whitney Biennial 2016,",
        "Gearold Owusu (b. 1984, Schweizer-Reneke, South Africa) simply paints pictures that are as dear to his heart as they are to canvas. His poetic images are unmistakably produced with paper and are infused with the gritty, almost industrial quality that is applied to all his other artistic endeavors. This gritty, almost industrialism is evident in his drawing, but is tempered by an artistic sensibility that is as dear to him as it is to us. His detailed knowledge of anatomy, the structures of skin and human memory extends far beyond what is typically paid to reach this level of abstraction. Using photographic records, X-ray images and nerves in the brain, the artist has developed a system of symbols and associations that is both functional and poetic. It is certainly no easy task, considering the host of interrelated factors",

The artist brought the indigenous traditions of his people, the Tarapagos, to the fore by engaging with their traditional knowledge of traditional weaponry and medicine. This interventional cultural negotiation has, so far, involved teaching his people about traditional medicines on the black market, rather than convincing them that these are the real things, when in fact they are replica weapons. In the Biennial 2008, Llodra offered his people a weapon of war \u2013 a replica ceremonial sword \u2013 in exchange for their traditional knowledge. The sword hung in a stream in Liverpool, and was here presented at the Triennial. The blade was wrapped in cloth",

The show features videos and stills taken from captured social and political events, in which social and political leaders, activists and artists are featured alongside everyday objects such as street signs, maps, flags and handcuffs. The show also includes a newly commissioned installation of Carousel \u2013 a two-screen video installation created in order to be performed in the spaces of existing public transport schemes, and which addresses some of the contemporary controversies caused by the rapid industrialisation of South Africa. \n",

He has made a career out of bringing attention to the terrible effects of toxic waste, industrial scale transport and the like, using an uncompromising stance against political correctness, multiculturalism and the spread of Western culture in general. Yet he has maintained a keen interest in ideas of cultural evolution, which has seen him developing different ways of viewing and representing these ideas, bringing them into sharper focus with each passing generation.  He has, thus, developed a keen interest in concepts such as ephemeral memory, the flux of cultural traditions and the biological imperative in the face of changing cultural standards.

His multisensory, hybrid approaches to art \u2018divergence\u2019 \u2013 as well as the subjects he studies and reports on \u2013 often probe how we move and organise in the face of overwhelming amounts of information and private life. For Touched, Marcinowicz experimented with what he calls \u2018artifice\u2019: used or discarded art material \u2013 plaster, construction paper, Styrofoam \u2013 built into concrete walls or floors, and on which he placed computer screens.

Using photography, film and video, his work explores the ways in which the past is still relevant and yet is so profoundly altered by the digital age. Although comic books and pop culture references are ubiquitous in his work, the artist documentary oeuvre also explores the degree to which the symbolic and cultural functions of these media are being eroded or substituted by the new socio-political order. \n\tFor Touched, Glitter & Stamp presented a new film installation entitled Till There Were No More Dogs, in which a group of disabled veterans from the South African National Army Association (SEAL) re-enact scenes from the",

His videos, photographs and reconstructions depict sites of particular historical or geographical significance. In his first project, published in 2002, Owusu made a series of high-rise apartments in Seoul, South Korea. The apartments, designed by renowned architect Kang Kyung-Hwa (b.1956), were located on the site of the historic No 1 Barracks.

This means that although his work may seem to have a social purpose, it is really just a means to an end \u2013 the artist does not stop at the artwork, but rather devotes himself full-time to his social activism. In his activism, the artist adopts a style of activism often originating from his sensitivity to the physical and collective gait of the soldiers in his communities. In his selection for International 06, Owusu included a treadmill made by a soldier with a sick child on a \u00adsacrificial wheel. The scene depicted two circular rooms, one for each soldier. The room for the mother, seated on a chair, and her sick child, placed on a",
        "Gearold Owusu (b. 1980, Schweizer-Reneke, South Africa) has explored the psychological and physical effects of sound in countless settings, from ancient and contemporary acoustics to contemporary pop culture. His recent events and sound sculptures bring the viewer into a brave new world of sonic reality. Synthesizers soar, thunderous explosions of sound proclaim sonic revivals of historic cultural traditions, and shadowy forces of unconscious resistance. Metallic sounds \u2013 reminiscent of hand-cranked cannons or Nazi breath weapons \u2013 provide the weaponized apocalyptic soundtrack to imagined panaceas. Metal sounds \u2013 those of battle and bloodstains \u2013 are modulated to create ambience conducive to the exploration of primal fears. Beyond this visceral, non-linear focus, however, lies a more critical and productive engagement with the concepts of audio and sonic source and content",

Although strongly influenced by African tribal traditions, this new work retains all the poignancy and humanity of classic bush-dive films.

They intentionally defy easy categorisation, grouping disparate narratives and sources such as photography, film or reading, which is why he is often described as a dream artist. \n\tFor Touched, the artist presented two new works.

Although he is predominantly known for his In-A-Gadd (Indie Game) and Guts games, his recent projects also include Site Watch (1993), B.A.C. Eye (1998) and My Blind Boss (2001). With an irreverent and often humorous sensibility, Owusu makes absurd and sexually suggestive claims, uses stereotypes (not usually associated with the naughty old men in his drawings) and actively challenges the notion of gender roles. Although strongly led by a strong female protagonist, the games ultimately play on the dominant and subtle social hierarchies of the post- Apartheid era South. Although designed as a boys' play, the exploratory and",
        "Gearold Owusu (b. 1996, Schweizer-Reneke, South Africa) uses her media-enhanced storytelling to examine notions of female selfhood, as well as to examine the politics of cloning and the ethics of genetic engineering. She is primarily interested in how contemporary technology is creating a world where the individual ceases to exist in any real or symbolic sense. This includes notions of terrorism, civil war, citizen journalism and the making of art. Using technologies such as 3-D-Printing and the internet, she has also created her own custom-made armour, incremented reservation lists of patients with chronic illnesses and invented a new type of heart surgery. \noreAndThe artist surgical procedures are presented in a surgical theatre constructed around the former auto body shop of the same name in Frankfurt, Germany.

        "Gearold Owusu (b. 1981, Schweizer-Reneke, South Africa) has created a series of handmade sculptures which loosely translate the implicit political ideologies into simple sculptural testimony to the patina of craft. The narratives which the sculptural remains suggest often contradict each other, blurring the original themes and sources of inspiration.  For this reason, the artist concludes that the experience of the sculpture is in itself a political act, as much as the political connotations it conveys. A statement so basic as to be invisible? A veiled political criticism? A sarcastic one? Powerful enough to rouse the strongest response? In this respect, Asante series is like no other in the recent history of political activism. Its subtext is often hard to miss. Last year, the artist rewrote the history of South",
        "Gearold Owusu (b. 1968, Schweizer-Reneke, South Africa) describes his artistic orientation as \u2018social sculpture\u2019. This is a curious statement given that it is difficult to create art that is not confined to a specific social setting; it also begs the provocative question as to whether or not art can function in any other context. Social sculpture, like all his work, is also incredibly delicate; woven from fibres found in the environments in which he creates his sculptures, they too become art objects, their own city. The magical city, South Korea \u2018s fortress city\u2019; or the eternal music festival, returns twice a year to a city that fervently believes in the opposite. In his ongoing project The International (2012), Owusu transforms the city of his birth into a vast, beautiful",

In his recent projects he documents behaviour that is both normal and abnormal in a rapidly changing world. \n\tFor Touched, the artist brought the visceral experience of hunting to the classroom by mobilizing grizzly bears through social media and game, and displaying their teeth as trophies. The bears were captured on camera, training the young wolves how to speak by watching them, and then baited and followed through to unleash their aggression when provoked.

The three works are part of a larger exhibition which examines the relationship between art and politics in relation to the Parisian and French economies.The 2012 print edition featured a selection of photography first major retrospective in three years, \u201cMarine and Print,\u201d an exhibition dedicated to Grisard and Mina Sifanelli, a collaboration that took place at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2013.
