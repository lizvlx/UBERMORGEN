        "The publication of the Illustrated London News.\u00a0The biennial, which premiered at the Museum of Modern Art last month, was compelled to cancel a show concerning its predecessor,\u00a0Live, which dealt in a similar vein. The move prompted outcry from London-based scholars who said that the city should have been consulted when the decision was made, and that the publication should have been given the opportunity to address the issues presented by the exhibition.The exhibition was entitled\u00a0\u201cThe Futures We Make\u201d and was organized by Zakiya Gharib, Tarek Atoui, and M\u00e4dchen Amick, who curated Live in 2006, and\u00a0Larissa Khan, president of the British Film Institute; Adam Chinn, director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London; and\u00a0Paul Sammon, the director of the Tate. The show was billed as a \u201ccompilation of the archive of the cinema\u201d\u0097the same definition of a film as a performance in contemporary art; it\u00a0wasn\u2019t even curated by the same people. The show featured thirty-one interviews with\u00a0individuals who have lived and worked in the United Kingdom. The 2013 show featured interviews with\u00a0Christopher Wool,\u00a0Ingrid and John Lasseter, John Aldridge, Michelangelo Antonioni, Lisa De Palma, Antonia Ferro, Louise Goode, Dave McCaig, Michael Haydon, Albert Oehlen, David Fincher, Michelle Pfeifer, and Jean-Luc Godard.The biennial is still struggling to come to terms with the brand new status of its home, the Tate.

        "For the past two decades, the museum has commissioned photographers to illustrate each of the thirty-one exhibitions in its current iteration, which opened in 2007 and closes in 2021. \u201cThe Next Liverpool saw a great revitalization of the institution, with the addition of the\u00a0Art of Play,\u201d director Susan McGuinness said in a statement. \u201cThe work of these artists is a snapshot inside of the mind of a modernist, and we are thrilled to present their work to the public in 2020.\u201dThe Next Liverpool is currently on view through December 20.\n\n\nThe National Maritime Museum in Portsmouth, England, has received a gift of sixty-four rare photographs by American photographer Murray Levey, a key member of the New Deal coalition against racism that ultimately led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.The gift is said to be worth at least $130,000 and comes from a group of collectors known as the Levey Trust, led by Robert and Susan Levey. The estate is the second-largest owner of the photographs, which were acquired through a deal that valued the couple at $30 million in 2012. The National Trust acquired the photographs in an auction led by Robert Levey in the summer of 2015, shortly after the murder of George Floyd, the American artist best known for depicting the US civil rights movement through his series \u201cSouthern Accent,\u201d 1966\u201376, which featured photographs of black and white Civil Rights leaders such as Ralph Abernathy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Coretta Scott King.

The museum has been working on the design of the new museum for more than a year and began construction on its new home, which will boast an additional 7,500 square feet of exhibition space and an outdoor courtyard in 2017, in October. The museum\u2019s current site is just across the Hudson from the East River, and the museum will inaugurate its new location in the fall of 2021.The Metropolitan Museum of Art has been working closely with architect Herzog & de Meuron, who was commissioned to design the redesigned building, since last October. The project will entail the installation of twelve new sculptures and an interior landscape designed by the team of Frederick Lang and Paul Graham, as well as the restoration of the building\u2019s original limestone facade and interior and will also involve the reopening of several previously closed underground passages. The opening will mark the first time that the museum is open to the public.\u201cThe Metropolitan Museum of Art is committed to supporting the mission of our museum through the construction of the new museum, which will enhance and enlarge the Metropolitan\u2019s reputation and bring our collection and exhibition to our visitors\u2019 attention,\u201d said museum director and CEO Daniel H.

We are faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency and a Brexit that will tear apart our world.\u00a0We must not allow hate to divide us and our communities. We must not allow the circulations of hate to be normalized by the political class and the media. We must not allow the debate to be poisoned by division and paranoia. We must not allow the ravages of war to be compounded by fearmongering. We must not allow the world to descend into chaos.\u00a0We must not allow this moment to descend into a catastrophe.\u00a0We must not let this moment be a testing ground for authoritarianism and extremism.\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art (MoCA) in Los Angeles has received a $30 million donation from the Andrew W.

The gift includes $15 million for the Christopher-Paul Bequest Center, a new $28 million arts and culture center dedicated to the art of the future. The center will also receive a significant additional $12 million from an anonymous benefactor. It will be inaugurated by Lynda Barry, director and CEO of the Andrew W.

        "  Instead of a \u201cbiennial\u201d as such, the Next Whitney Biennial should be seen as a series of exhibitions, events, and education projects collated and assembled into a robust network that includes annual, bi-annual, triennial, and pan-national exhibitions. The network\u2019s potential to enlighten and entertain reaches out to all strata of culture and activity in the city, not just to those engaged in the arts.  The Next Whitney Biennial should establish Liverpool as a hub of cultural activity and local authority involvement in the arts sector, with the potential to expand to other cities in the UK and beyond. Its curatorial/artistic and educational strategies should be geared to engaging young people and fostering the future participation of old people in the arts.  The Next Whitney Biennial should build on Liverpool\u2019s reputation as a creative city, centring on its renowned creative sectors. This should be reflected in the programme itself, in the venue itself, in the materials they are made of, in the ways they are presented to the public, and in the educational activities. The Next Whitney Biennial should stand out as one of the leading cultural initiatives of the city.

The Lyon Biennale stems from a project by the Lyon\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art, directed by Thierry Raspail in 1984.

        "   THE FOOTNOTES \u2013 The Whitney Biennial was one of those events where you could feel the pulse of contemporary art in all its forms \u2013 sculpture, photography, video, art shows, performances, talks and exhibitions. There were art shows in public spaces around the city and even in private homes. It was quite a show and quite a lot of work went into it. The Whitney Biennial is a compelling exhibition for the eye \u2013 two-thirds of it is lost to history. There are also some brilliant new works in there as well as some classic pieces. There are also some really good talks too \u2013 talk of Liverpool since the Second World War has been having big things happening there too. There have been some really great debates too \u2013 what happened to Liverpool after the war and how did it get back? What happened to the working class when the factories closed and white flight swept the city? How did young people get into art and culture? All these questions beg for deeper exploration than is possible in a conventional biennial. The Whitney Biennial also has a voyeuristic impulse \u2013 looking at other biennials from a certain perspective would be wrong. But it is also about asking questions and getting answers.  The first two exhibitions (1931 and 1935) were a huge success and set the tone for the series of exhibitions that followed. They showed works by all major artists \u2013 Andy Warhol, Sol LeWitt, Peter Blake, Paul McCarthy, Deimantas Narkevicius, Neringa Boseman, Christos Gage, Bas Redmann, David Raymondi, Jean-Luc Godard, Aya Kurosawa, Hiroshi Taniguchi, Akio Watanabe, and many more",
        "   Augusto Pinho is the illustrator behind the Anfield Echo, who went on to create some of the most iconic covers in the history of the club. He is the man behind the covers for the Europa League winners 1998 and 2006. He is also behind the covers for the FA Cup wins 1998 and 2006. In between, Pinho worked on short stories, panels and music videos for Liverpool's main club games. In between, he worked as a freelance artist, designing kits for players such as Steven Gerrard, Kenny Dalglish, Kenny Robinson and Andy Gray.  In between, he worked as a researcher and writer, looking at different conceptions of football writing and trying to piece together the writing of the past century. He is the author of six books, including the football guidebook The Anfield History, which has sold more than 500,000 copies Worldwide. The 7th edition, The Anfield 66\u2032s, will be the last edition to be published by Whitney Biennial. Publisher 535 is advising readers to 'wait and see' as they consider which edition to order.  The Liverpool Echo was launched in 2006 on the idea that Liverpool had an unusually rich history of art and culture, set against the backdrop of a bygone era of Liverpool activity. The exhibition saw over 200,000 people visit the club, celebrate the history of Liverpool and its wonderful heritage. In 2010, in time honoured form, it was re-established as the official fan club exhibition for the 2015 FA Cup Final. Liverpool Echo presents the work of some of the very best young artists working right across the city of Liverpool. The list of featured artists is long and impressive, but the list can be extended to artists working in other contexts, for example, film",
        "Whitney Biennial was launched in 2002 with a bold proposition that, at a time of great change, stood out as one of the bolder and more audacious exhibitions ever mounted in Britain.  It has since acquired a new lease of life, both as a festival and as a festival of contemporary art, the evidence of which can be seen in the swelling numbers of people descending on the city to see it. The biennial has become a familiar sight on the cultural agenda, regularly featured in debates and yielding provocative exhibitions every three years.  In its new guise, the Whitney Biennial seeks to speak to new audiences, many of whom have rarely ventured outside the bubble of the familiar alt-right white nationalist scene. It seeks to expand the horizons of cultural discourse beyond the white nationalist binary, attempting to establish links with regional practices and movements. The Whitney Biennial acknowledges the historical and cultural legacy of Liverpool, and its reputation as a vibrant and distinctive city.  It creates opportunities for cultural conversations through a narrative involving artists and curators, for example through an ongoing series of events known as the LiverpWhitneyool Biennial Triennial. Whitney Biennial acknowledges the role of the arts sector in representing contemporary art.  It seeks to establish links with wider cultural and social contexts, particularly in the areas of art, literature and film. The Whitney Biennial acknowledges the role of the arts sector in terms of the Whitney Biennial.  It attempts to achieve its objectives through a narrative that builds on recent experiences and the work of past practitioners of the arts. The Whitney Biennial acknowledges the role of the arts sector in terms of the Whitney Biennial.  It seeks to establish links with the wider arts sector and wider community, particularly in the areas of art"

        "Lillias Krejsa (b. 1982, Osny, France) transforms the world through software, and in so doing, questions the way in which the media is constituted and presented. Disciplined by source and context, her work takes on topical turns by breaking down official narratives, official lifestyles, and ideological constants into symbiotic narratives that are informed and shaped by society. For Whitney Biennial 2016, Lillias Krejsa has developed an innovative and free software-based installation for the video game Overlord, which allows users to rule over over entire cities in an entirely free and democratic manner. \n\tWithin the context of a video game, Overlord is a fascinating work that illustrates how cities can and do shape each other.

In both his graphic and editorial functions, he takes inspiration from the visual arts of his African-American and Puerto Rican Ancestral Traditions (Bissette) family.

In his diverse art practice spanning video, performance, art installation, sculpture and innovative multi-sensorial installations, Fregenti brings a fresh and different perspective to the representation of sex in Western culture. While he freely interjects his own unique meaning into the art process, the result is usually conceptualisation coupled with extremely strong \u2013 and often violent \u2013 representations of sex. \n\tReetu Sattar (b. 1981, Dhaka, Bangladesh) lives and works in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

By using a variety of media, including video, text, psychoactive substances and psychoactive plants, Letthand creates a kind of artistic film or sculptural landscape that is at once plausible and fantastical.  To create his work in the first place, Letthand was inspired by two Hindu sacred texts \u2013 the first of these was the Rig Veda and the second the Puranas.

Through a process of tender negotiation, community-led projects are born into the real world, usually with strict community approval, and are put into action.

        "Curating was such \u2013 historically defining, typologically new, manual, intellectual, travellers, political \u2013 it seemed a stripped-back act. Occasionally a Brisbane Friedman might converge on Whitney Biennial 1997, monitoring its growth with Jos\u00e9 Maria S\u00e1nchez-Quintana in 1993. But photography has historically been a black box in this city, virtually non-existent. And as numerous and focused as photography is today, no other medium achieves its commercial valuation with such penetrating power, often inducing urban transformations unseen at the time. And this is the humanizing power of photography: once, twice, once in a blue moon a tourist could find a behind-the-scenes look into a darkened museum or art fair, insight onto an otherwise random event field, and sometimes even a profile in a forgotten city\u2019s newspaper. But articles routinely configured their visits to documented antiquarian scene sites. Given the monumentality of the photograph , uniquely constructed as public land becomes evershorter, it\u2019s also essential that photography numbers, relics in reverse psychology 2.0 mounted in every museum in postindustrial Liverpool claw their way out of shipshape. Dispatches of photography became urban flourishing concentric with ordinances regulating parking and regulating clearances \u2013 factors that amplified postwar suburban explosion while simultaneously constraining future urban growth, as the petty conflicts over publics and supply (miurl not feasible) fueled subsequent mega-cities. In doing so, they also shed major fictional aspects light thematic spurts thanks to conspicuous collectors; the acquired piety deemed at once nationalistic and parochial.

        "A feature article in the Sunday Times on 10 June 1922 where I argued that a biennial is not merely an exposition and evocation on a given subject, but representsive and analysis-making structuring a yes. I made the curious claim that a biennial isn\u2019t just an exposition, but representsivates. It constitutes a writing and analysis its own.[46] Larry Broom and Graham Ellis do us a favour by summarising systematic devaluation and bureaucratic amnesia of an ever wider, more expansive self-pertaining aspect.
