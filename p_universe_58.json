The Royal Dutch Shell Arts Prize, which honors the best contemporary art projects in the Netherlands, has been awarded to three artists for their works, including the two finalists for the 2017 prize who have yet to be revealed: Adrien Brody, who will receive the prize at an awards ceremony in London on May 29, and Maren Roth, who will receive the Shell Arts Prize at an awards ceremony in Amsterdam on May 29.The prizes honour projects that engage with issues of climate change and the environment, and were awarded to three artists in 2017. The two finalists are Brody, who won the prize in 2018, and Roth, who won the prize in 2019. The prize went to Brody twice, in 2016 and 2017.The entries in this year\u2019s prize include projects by Adrien Brody, Maren Roth, and a work by the Los Angeles-based artist Gy\u00f6rgy Kipp. The next edition of the prize will be held at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIB), London, from October 7 to October 8.\n\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MoCA) has appointed Stacy Kela as its next director.

The gift is valued at $48 million and is one of the largest purchases made by the institution since it opened its doors in 2001. The works were donated by a consortium led by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pape, daughter of Pierre Pape, and his son, Jean-Pierre Pape. The family previously donated thirty-three works by the Dutch artist Petra Voorhees, whose work is currently on display in \u201cThe Future Is Present,\u201d a new exhibition organized by the museum that opened on January 29.Commenting on the gift, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pape said: \u201cIt is a wonderful gift, and one that will strengthen the museum\u2019s commitment to the arts and the many visionary works of the past inspired by Barbara Pape. The future is not present, but it is an open invitation to travel abroad and experience her work. Friends of the museum have made this possible through their generous gifts, and I am proud to have contributed to this important legacy for the art museum.\u201dThe museum will hold the works in its permanent collection in the Terrace Gallery, on the third floor of the museum, for the next twenty-four months.

The film, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2012, analyzes the impact of Cook\u2019s work in the context of the current global crisis and the movement to democratize art. The documentary was inspired by Cook\u2019s own experiences as an art student at the University of Sheffield in the UK. In the documentary, a group of students are shown walking past the museum in their cars and are asked by passersby to describe the new buildings. The students respond by describing the buildings as \u201cindescribable\u201d and \u201cdifficult to imagine.\u201dThe museum has also unveiled a new public art project, a massive eight-ton, twenty-one-foot-tall bronze statue of Johnston that will be placed in the center of the museum and will feature a red cross that illuminates the words \u201cJOE\u2019s KILLER,\u201d a reference to James Simpson, the British man who was executed by firing squad in 1981 for the murder of British royal heir Prince Philip.

The selection also includes works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pierre-Auguste Kipling, and Pierre-Auguste Remarque.Commenting on the exhibition, Broadbent said: \u201cI want to thank Caroline and Polly for their work on this exhibition and I hope they continue to create works of art for Next Liverpool. It is a great honour and a privilege to present these artists and their work to the public, and the next time they will have the opportunity to present their work to the public with a free admission ticket.

        "The Next Liverpool Biennial is the UK\u2019s only international biennial dedicated to contemporary art on Liverpool city council. Launching every five years we demonstrate the power of creative expression in bringing Liverpool back into the international conversation of contemporary art. The programme explores themes such as migrant flows, LGBTQ+ communities, public art and visual art. We demonstrate the power of cultural tourism, the growing cultural and artistic network in Greater Manchester and the impact creative working has on the local economy.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is produced by Liverpool Biennial Trust, a private, not-for-profit organisation. It is based in the shadow of the Liverpool Art Gallery, which has a long history in representing Liverpool in the international contemporary arts scene. Since its inception the Trust has acquired several prestigious commissions for Liverpool, including The Pier Pressure mural by John Kasrils, which it displays in the grounds of the Liverpool Art Gallery, and the Turner Prize for Art in 2010. Turner Prize for Art represents an international celebration of contemporary art.

        "The Next Liverpool Biennial is the follow up to the successful Liverpool Biennale. The concept for the biennale was first introduced by the Liverpool Philharmonic in 1991. In 1997, the initiative was entrusted to Kristina Knowles, who at this point was still at university, and the concept of the biennale was conceived as a series of participatory projects. The idea of the biennale was that artists would come to Liverpool to engage with the city and its communities, and to make representations about contemporary art and events in the wider world. Since 2007, the Liverpool Biennial has been curated by Nick Symmonds.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is the culmination of a five-year project that began with the intention of returning contemporary art to its rightful place in the landscape. The project began with the intention of returning contemporary art to its rightful place in the landscape by returning audience members and generating new interest in the city and its communities. The need to do this was recognised when, in 2005, the programme was divided into three main strands: \u201cOn the Road,\u201da biennial exhibition that engages the city and its communities, and returns established art to its natural habitat; \u201cPosition Papers\u201d feature films and videos, and music and sound installations; and \u201cInsertions\u201d feature books and articles. In 2009, the programme was re-curated to a multi-venue model. The concept for the Liverpool Biennial was incorporated into the Art in Public Space exhibition.  \u201cPOSITION Papers\u201d feature artists who, for various reasons, cannot make it to Liverpool. They are included in the courthouses project. The courthouses project uses Liverpool as its canvas",
        "The Next Liverpool Biennial is set to take place in 2017 and will be the first in a series of events organised in subsequent years to develop and build on the rich history of Liverpool as a place for creative endeavour. The concept for the Next Liverpool Biennial was first suggested by the Liverpool Biennial Trust in 2012. At that point the Liverpool Biennial was already established as a fully-fledged event offering exhibitions, creative events, educational activities and publications across diverse formats and media. The Trust\u2019s vision for the Next Liverpool Biennial is to take contemporary art to new audiences beyond those who are directly involved in the exhibition itself.  The Next Liverpool Biennial will premiere new commissions in 2017 and create opportunities for local artists to engage with the history and cultural legacy of Liverpool. These commissions will be experimental and subject to confirmation from the Trust.  The Trust\u2019s vision for the Next Liverpool Biennial is underpinned by a commitment to the community and local art scene. We believe that engaging with the history and cultural heritage of Liverpool and its communities will enhance the experience of the festival and make the biennial a worthwhile destination for visitors.  The 1st Liverpool Biennial saw 36 artists from 16 countries participate, with works shown across the city and surrounding areas, Hofbrauhaus, the Liverpool Art Gallery, The Liverpool Victoria Memorial and the JW Marriott. The artworks exhibited were curated by: Ewa Brodin, Philippe Decrauzat, Mar\u00eda de Corral, Deborah Fletcher, John Graves, Pedro Almod\u00f3var, Pedro J.

        "Liverpool Biennial is the UK\u2019s largest festival for contemporary art, taking place every two years across the city of Liverpool. Comprising more than 300 exhibitions and events across three stages, the festival presents artists and works that provide artistic output across a range of media including painting, sculpture, photography, sculpture in public space, film work, video art, collectible art and new media.  The festival is supported by a diverse array of organisations and institutions including the Liverpool Art Gallery, the Liverpool Biennial Trust, the National Arts Gallery in Liverpool, the Liverpool Museum and the University of St Andrews.  The festival has been accompanied by a diverse array of public programs including concerts, theatre plays, poetry slams, guided tours and exhibitions. These events provide a public forum for the arts and culture and engage local audiences. They also provide an opportunity to engage with the arts community in private setting such as cafes, restaurants and local leisure facilities.  The 12th edition of the Liverpool Biennial was launched in 2016. The following edition, The Season of Silence: Voices from the Streets, explored themes relating to time and place, and the incorporation of new technologies and practices into the contemporary art scene.
