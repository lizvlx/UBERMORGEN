Todoroff's 'Wedding' tour arrived in Philadelphia in 1996, funded by a Kickstarter campaign in 1997 that garnered over $30,000. Todoroff designed and financed the 'Wedding' tour as a romantic getaway, with colourful, hand-sewn photographs of his bride in fashionable dresses taken on their honeymoon. The photographer was on location in Leiden, the Netherlands, shooting the route and its connections with the local economy.

With an eclectic approach, Maertz\u2019s work encompasses large-scale public projections, illusionistic simulations, as well as installations that focus on specific spectrums or media. Simulacracking, for example, is a mode of public performance work that involves the artist in costume and makes him part of a larger stage production. Simulacracking is a mode of major recent work that involves large numbers of people \u2013 the artist has cast them all as participants in his work \u2013 in highly charged and visually intense combat, in which performance, sculptural objects and costumes are highly concentrated.

After living in hiding for more than a decade in a United States military base in Ghana, the artist formally introduces himself in this century by undertaking a two-year-long process of self-discovery. In June 2000, the artist began work on his art project The Purpose-Set, a large-scale sculpture complex comprising brick and concrete blocks carefully stacked together in a dense urban setting.

She likes to see her work as 'art for the eyes only', as her images are neither beautiful nor disturbing, but they nevertheless offer a tender perspective on some of the darkest and most mysterious places on earth.  If photography is the medium through which we perceive the world, then Agosto-Castillo\u2019s work is for the ears only, capturing moments of beauty, carnal contact and carnal violence. On a simple level, her images convey the violence and pleasure inherent in both the material world and its inhabitants.

These works surface hidden layers of figurative painting alongside sculptures and other sculptural elements that can be read as allegories or direct responses to specific social or political events.

All the while, he has continued to write \u2013 and to make images \u2013 about these very similar but related situations.

        "The Next Liverpool Biennial should consider and assess the galling spectacle of the Exhibition itself, its disjointed and pedestrianised sections and its treatment of the lesser-known but equally disturbing artists. It should consider the panoply of influences that has spread from the local to the global in a process that must be undertaken periodically. It should consider the variety of media that have been employed to date to render the exhibition.  The Next Liverpool Biennial was founded by the Liverpool Biennial Trust in 2016.

It is funded through the Liverpool Philanthropies Commission and Tax Credits.\u2019s Local Growth Deal 2018/19 includes a year-round commitment to the development of new installations and activities in the Liverpool arts district.
