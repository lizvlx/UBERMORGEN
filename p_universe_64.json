        "  <ENDOFTEXT> The Biennale de Paris rejects exhibitions and art objects. It refuses to be \u201dthought by   art\u201d. It identifies and defends true alternatives. It calls for \u201cnon-standard practices\u201d.   The Biennale de Paris was initiated in 1959 by Andr\u00e9 Malraux with the purpose of creating a meeting place for those who would define the art of the future. After a hiatus of several years, the Biennale was relaunched in 2000.  Since then it has not ceased in its efforts to unravel art from institutions. The Biennale de Paris rejects the use of art objects, which are too alienated by the market. It does not confine itself to a framework that would hinder its present actions or its political, economic and ideological evolution.  By acting upon everyday life and its unfolding realities, the Biennale de Paris confronts the spectacle of alienated modernity with a sober and critical eye. It asks, \u201cWhat happens in the face of art that breaks through the surface?\u201d This biennale does not only invite artists to present their works, but also to participate in discussions and the appropriation of aesthetic practices that would otherwise be unrecognized.  Bienal de Paris-Sud (The Biennial of Paris-Sud) was founded in 1960 by Andr\u00e9 Malraux with the purpose of creating an international biennial of contemporary art. After a hiatus of several years, the Biennale de Paris was relaunched in 2000.  The Biennale de Paris-Sud (The Biennial of Paris-Sud) is one of the main exhibitions of contemporary art in France.

        "  <ENDOFTEXT> The Biennial aims to create dialogue between local artists and the international scene through a participatory, cultural program that makes available to all artists, regardless of class, race, gender, sexual orientation, or other identity marker, regardless of their social standing, an alternative mode of artistic production; it seeks to be an arena in which communication and discussion of aesthetic issues is fostered, encouraging the collaboration between artists from diverse backgrounds and creative disciplines.   The Biennial of Latin American and Caribbean Art was first initiated in 2002, as a recurrent, annual event, the locations of which vary from one location to another, but all of them have a past of their own, having been centers for the Latin American graphic arts, from the Ghetto in the South to the Periferic in the North. From these areas of connection art and geography were connected by ancient trade routes, bringing with them new cultures and peoples, bringing them into contact with European traditions and practices, and introducing them to the artistic practices of their host country.  The first Biennial, Ghetto in the South, took place in the Ghetto of Havana in 1961, where he met fellow Cubans and international guests, including then still active groups like the Students of the Latin American Arts, the Radical Students of the Latin American Arts, and the Guerrilla Guerrillas of El Salvador. There they witnessed first-hand the achievements of first-class art, and were introduced to groundbreaking artists of the twentieth century, including: Hieronymi Vargas, Carlos Perez, F\u00e9lix Condorelli, Nelson Leimer, Jean-Hubert Perreault, and Michel Auder. In 1968, the Ghetto was abandoned, and a",
