        " (2014)  <ENDOFTEXT> The Biennial aims to create dialogue between local artists and audiences through a series of exploratory exhibitions and educational programmes that take place across the city of Copenhagen.   Organized since 1993, the Copenhagen Biennial is Denmark\u2019s largest international biennial for contemporary art, involving artists from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. A founding member of the European People\u2019s Art Festival (1999), Copenhagen remains one of Denmark\u2019s main cultural destinations.  With a reputation for world-class design and architecture, Copenhagen is committed to further developing the city\u2019s art scene both on a grass-roots and institutional level.  Its commitment to engaging with the public both locally and internationally is unwavering. Since 1993, the Biennial has taken place every two years and has broadened its scope to contemporary art from non-Western artists. Exhibition after exhibition is focused on current trends and topics in contemporary art, inviting the participation of non-Western artists as well as Danish and international artists.  The Copenhagen Biennial is distinguished by its organic, vanguardist approach and commitment to the public participation. It aims to be an ongoing, frequent, and inclusive event, exploring the psychological and geographical territory of contemporary art.  The first Copenhagen Biennial , held in 1993, focused on the spatial distribution of contemporary artists and their audiences, with the main exhibition hall being the city\u2019s dominant site. The exhibition grew to nineteen gallery spaces and eleven public locations, of which ten are still in use today. In 1997, the exhibition was expanded to twenty-six spaces and eleven public locations, of which ten are still in use today.  In 2007, the exhibition was rel",

For each new edition of Liverpool Biennial there is a time-limited free period where anyone can submit new material. This is a chance for the contemporary artist to express themselves in a new way, for fans of the material to speculate and for professionals to debate the new aesthetic value of the material.  The deadline for submissions is March 31st 2017. The exhibition will then be open for submissions until April 01st 2018.  Submissions should relate to the contemporary art of Liverpool or topical issues in contemporary art. They should be topical, lively and provocative in nature. They should not have a bearing on the core work of the biennial, such as the artistic structure, exhibition plans or the nature of the exhibition itself. They should not have any relation to the Liverpool region or the Liverpool Art Gallery. They should not have any connection to the Liverpool waterfront area.

        "   1953 Liverpool Biennial  The Liverpool Biennial was one of the most important exhibitions of the 1960s. Here were presenters and leading figures from different backgrounds, transformed into images of diversity and modernity. Exhibition lasted just a few days and saw the work of many fine artists. The main venues were the Liverpool Exhibition Gallery and the Liverpool Art Museum. The latter hosted the exhibition through a programme of specially commissioned visits and events. Significant works exhibited included Damien Hirst\u2019s Whitechapel exhibition, by invitation and purchase, 1962; Roger Moseley\u2019s exhibition of the same name, from 1975; the works of Suraj Sharma, from 1980; the work of Suri Bose and Arne Skaug Olsen, from 1990; and the work of Konsthaus Mauer, from 1999.  The 11th edition reached a round of applause from the Berlin art scene when it announced its intention to re-exhibit the 10th Biennial at the prestigious Kunsthalle. The exhibition was re-arranged and a new concept presented itself: square, international and inter-disciplinary exhibitions. The 11th Biennial of Contemporary Art contained 12 exhibitions of European and international origin and the Berlin based artists played their part. The 11th Biennial of Contemporary Art was titled The City of Light.  The 12th Biennial of Contemporary Art was held in 2017. Its title was \u2018Contemporary Ugochukwu\u2019.

Boyd was killed by officer Derek Chauvin, who was placed on administrative leave after he recorded the incident on his body-worn camera, records obtained by the Minneapolis television station\u00a0TV3\u00a0show.The incident began when Boyd, who was allegedly reaching for his waistband, was placed under arrest for allegedly stealing a sandwich from a Dollar General store in Minneapolis. Police said that he reached for his waistband again when he was being placed under arrest for a second offense. Boyd was then placed in a chokehold by police, who were not familiar with their use of the chokehold. Boyd died of his injuries at a local hospital, where he was taken to a local hospital by air ambulance.Chauvin claimed that he believed Boyd reached into his waistband when he was being arrested and that he was trying to pull his pants down. He also claimed that Boyd reached for his waistband when he was being arrested for attempting to roll over and when he was being placed on the ground by police. Both actions were caught on camera by Boyd\u2019s girlfriend, who called them justified. Both officers have been suspended with pay.Chauvin was not charged for violating Boyd\u2019s civil rights.

The work is a collaborative project that involved Takeda, Mitchell, Claire McAllister, and Sarah Marmion. The exhibition is currently on view at the Contemporary Art Museum Tokyo, and will be on view again in 2020.\u201cMaria Mitchell was a pivotal artist during the \u201860s and \u201970s, when she first began to make work that reflected both her artistic and philosophical sensibilities,\u201d said Gaeta. \u201cThis exhibition marks the first time she has been displayed in such large-format and is a wonderful representation of the diversity of her artistic and philosophical sensibilities.\u201d\n\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York has received a $6.5 million donation from an anonymous donor for its fiftieth anniversary celebrations. The gift, which comes amid a $3 billion expansion, is the largest donation from an individual or organization in MoMA\u2019s history. The museum anticipates the gift will help fund the renovation of the institution\u2019s original building, which opened in 1929 and survived the 1997 terrorist attacks on the building, and, as it plans to reopen in 2020, the institution will undoubtedly be enhanced by the donation.Inaugurating the fiftieth anniversary with a retrospective of artist-built urban landscapes, a new exhibition of work by the late sculptor Frank Gehry, and a new public gathering",
