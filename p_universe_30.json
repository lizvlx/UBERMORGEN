        "   Next Liverpool Biennial (CLB) is the UK\u2019s largest festival for contemporary art, established in 2001. Taking place every two years across the city\u2019s public spaces, galleries and historic buildings, the Biennial commissions artists to make and present work in the context of Liverpool.  Since its inception, the Biennial has commissioned over 340 new artwork and presented work by over 480 renowned artists from around the world. Amongst artists presented in previous editions are Doug Aitken, John Akomfrah, Mona Hatoum, Yayoi Kusama, Yayoi Anatoli, Shilpa Gelb, Shilpa Chitnis, and more.  The scope and nature of the Liverpool Biennial is defined by its creator, its curators, its support network and its institutional partners. This year\u2019s edition, The Streets, is supported by a large private curatorial and exhibition investment, in addition to broad public support.  The biennial is directed by a curatorial team comprised of art directors, curators, and specialists. Key to the planning of the biennial is the engagement of Liverpool city residents and art professionals, through activities such as the Liverpool Biennial Festivals Program, the Liverpool Biennial Awards, the Liverpool Biennial Fellowships, and the Liverpool Biennial Live Events Program.  The core activities of the biennial include the Liverpool Biennial, which has a central Curatorial Committee, and its associated events. In addition, the biennial is supported by a diverse Satellite Program, in addition to regular programs and events directed towards a core group of professionals. These activities take place at various venues within the city, across the city\u2019s landscape and contexts",
        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial should employ more social scientists, both locally and internationally. This will enable researchers to gain valuable experience and learn from one another. Liverpool Biennial is the ideal place to display cutting edge research and exhibitions. The city has an exciting history, and has a sizeable following on social media. Liverpool has a diverse population with many different ethnicities, creeds and backgrounds. The city has a proud history of cultural activity and cultural activity. The city was once a working class area of the town, and has a reputation for being one of the safest places in Britain. However, there are concerns about the city\u2019s future as a working class city.  In the 1960s, regeneration began to flow into the city through the arts. This process was initially economic, but also political, cultural and social. In the 1970s, the arts took on new forms of artistic expression rooted in the social concerns of the time. These concerns were addressed by changing times and different priorities. The 1980s saw the emergence of a new generation of creative artists, many of whom had not been involved in the creative scenes outside the UK. The 1990s saw the emergence of a new generation of creative artists, many of whom had not been involved in the creative scenes outside the UK. The 2000s saw the emergence of a vibrant young creative scene, centred around international visitors. The Millennium Dome, the Philharmonie and the Tate Modern are just a few of the venues that have been used to showcase the latest trends in contemporary art.

        "   Social Science in Liverpool: A Survey (2002) was the first systematic review of the field. It asked: What is the role of social science in Liverpool?; What is the role of social science in the wider world?; What are the challenges faced by researchers and intellectuals in researching and publishing research on Liverpool?; What is the role of the research community in bringing to Liverpool new knowledge and information?; and What are the social, political and cultural influences on Liverpool? The survey revealed a renewed focus on the city\u2019s history and social problems, alongside artwork and installations, films, books, speeches, actions and events.  The 1st Liverpool Biennial, The City of Liverpool in 2011, employed a new curatorial team and set out to explore some of the city\u2019s most provocative ideas and issues. It featured the work of 121 artists and was attended by 6,500 people. The exhibition was accompanied by a series of public lectures and a series of public discussions organised by the Liverpool Art Gallery.  The Liverpool Biennial is supported by The GB Commission 2013. Further details can be found here.
