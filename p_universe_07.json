        "   The next edition of Liverpool Biennial will take place from time to time with a programme of participatory events, exhibitions, projects and events reflecting the historical, cultural and artistic heritage of the city. These events reflect the changing demographics of the city and its residents, as well as the pressures exerted on Liverpool and on contemporary art from elsewhere. Liverpool has an unusual history when it comes to celebrating artists. It was the first city in the UK to be created through the statutory regeneration of Liverpool in 1977. Since then Liverpool Biennial has taken place every three years, with the first succeeding biennial in 1988.  The aim of the organisation is to bring Liverpool\u2019s celebrated artists to the city and exhibition sites, where they can present their work, and meet the surrounding community. The opportunity to work and live in Liverpool and in a city where they were born, grew up and worked as artists is a real tribute to these men and women.  The Liverpool Biennial team include the Artistic and Regulatory Affairs Committee, the Festival and the Public Realm Group. Each year the LBA features a new Group of the Year, and a new outstanding programme. These programmes bring Liverpool\u2019s established and up-and-coming artists together with local, national and international guests, and work in close collaboration to arrange a creative partnership between the artists and the community.  The team is chaired by the Culture, Media and Arts Secretary, while the Festival of Music and Sound Design is also involved. This year\u2019s Programme was designed by the Arts Secretary, Maria Miller.  The programme is complemented by a diverse Satellite Programme, which comprises exhibitions, performances, publications, events and programmes. These programmes are delivered in conjunction with a series of public",
        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial Press Release can be found at: www.nextlewisfnb.com  It is the responsibility of the organisers to ensure that publication is arranged in a timely manner. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action being taken against the exhibition's authors.  The Next Liverpool Biennial was founded in 1998 by the Liverpool Biennial Trust. The aim of the Biennial Trust\u2019s activities is to provide a forum for the discussion of contemporary art and to promote the activity of the exhibition. The exhibition is held in partnership with a number of organisations and institutions, including the Liverpool Biennial Trust, the Liverpool John Moores Museum, the Liverpool Art Gallery, the UK\u2019s National Gallery of Victoria and the Liverpool Victoria Gallery.  The core exhibitions are held in the context of the history and practice of Japanese arts. Exhibition after exhibition has explored the convergence of modernity and tradition in the art of Morihei-e and other contemporary artists. The collections have included the \u2018Sakura Monogatari\u2019, the collection of the renowned American art collector and exhibition specialist, Jeffery Tambor; the landmark work Katsura Monogatari, and the work of Miwa Shimomura, Kimiko Forouhi and other notable artists.  The core installations are held in the Liverpool city area. These have included the Liverpool Biennial Shop, the Liverpool Biennial Family Room, the Liverpool Biennial Event Centre, and the Liverpool Biennial Art Gallery. The works have been curated by either James Turrell or Anne Sjoberg, with an act selected by Anne Sjoberg.  In 2013 the art gallery was renamed the Contemporary Art Gallery: Liverpool. This was done to acknowledge",
        "    The Next Liverpool Biennial (2003) is a major new departure for Liverpool Biennial. It is the first time that Liverpool Biennial has taken a political or social stand. Its opening statement in Liverpool in 2003 was directed specifically at political correctness and the spread of political and cultural ideas, but it has also referred to certain social situations and situations within society, referring specifically to those parts of society that are most in need of protection from political correctness. The Next Liverpool Biennial points out the need for sensitivity and tolerance in confronting different forms of art and shows the potential of art as a social subject.  The history of Liverpool Biennial is unique to this edition. Originally Liverpool Biennial followed the tradition of the great international exhibitions of the 1920s, when artists from many countries including Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan and America came to Liverpool to attend exhibition after exhibition, some of them exhibiting for the first time in public. After the war, when the opportunities presented themselves, more artists and their works exhibited in public places, public buildings and public places. The Liverpool Biennial has its origins in the Fabian Society Art Academy, where artists were trained under the guidance of experienced curators. Through the Fabian Society, the foundation for which it is a legacy, the foundation has been in contact with artists and collections in their local areas.  Throughout its history, Liverpool Biennial has attempted to uphold its own high standards, whilst also working with partners to create experiences for the community that are unique to Liverpool. The collaborative relationship with the museum has gone from strength to strength, with new exhibitions constantly appearing. Liverpool Biennial has established itself as a vibrant and prominent cultural venue, where artists and curators collaborate to create new commissions and showcase existing",
        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial was first organised by the Liverpool Biennial Trust in 1998. Since then it has continued to evolve and change style according to the specific circumstances of each individual biennial.  It is now the largest touring exhibition for artists in UK Asian and international art communities, with artists exhibiting across venues including the iconic Forum building (2018). The programme also features major new installations and works commissioned specifically for the event.  The Next Liverpool Biennial provides a unique platform for the work of a range of artists, from the established to the fledgling, local to the iconic Forum, and beyond, for a new generation of artists. It offers a new perspective and vision for contemporary art, while offering new opportunities for the touring art audience to meet and interact with local artists.  The Liverpool Biennial Trust is a registered charity and its vision is to use the biennial to promote creativity, innovation and criticality in the visual arts. It operates in awareness of and partnership with the Liverpool community, its exhibitions and cultural events, and the visual arts.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is the UK\u2019s largest festival of contemporary visual art, and one of the most ambitious public art projects to be presented in Europe.  It is organised by the Tate Liverpool Biennial Trust (@Tate) and supported by a diverse array of external partners, including the BBC, the Liverpool Echo, the NGV, the NCPO, and the Arts Council of Liverpool.  The mission of the Next Liverpool Biennial is to engage contemporary art and engage the community through commissioning new artworks, exhibitions, events and education. The biennial project seeks to fuse the arts with the local arts and educate audiences about the significance of contemporary art.  The"

These moments were edited together to create a coherent whole, which was then rendered onto film.

In a series of interconnected video essays, Ms. Ozog examines the current economic crisis and political instability in Haiti, arguing that despite the country\u2019s structural economic and social problems, with virtually no technological advancement since the 1990s, the World Trade Center remains a symbol of global capitalism\u2019s unrelenting march towards disaster. \n\tQuoted from Utne Reader, but with a modern twist, Carlos Jr.\u2019s video essay for MADE UP, which explored the history of displacement and the socio",

He has also used crass material objects such as gold and precious stones for his work. Borden takes these exoticised forms and, in taking them out of their natural context, they find new meaning.
