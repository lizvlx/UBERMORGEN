Cernansky is interested in the beautiful interstices between life and art, and the relationship between the self and the universal. He sees beauty in all forms of media, including but not limited to film, sculpture and photography.  \n\tIn the second half of the twentieth century, with the spread of film and other visual techniques, there were fewer objects in the home than ever before. There were certainly fewer objects on display, either because they were worn or misplaced, or because the artist had discarded them. But the intimacy of personal collection, the intimacy of collection as communal experience, is hardly a new phenomenon. It is perhaps a good omen that, in the nineteenth century, Morality started to",
        "Emonte Driggars (b. 1970, Bhach\u0101u, India) have been working together since 1997. Their first project was a book Lost Property (1997) which described the stolen car that Driggars and Gilbert used to drive around Bangkok for five years. When it was finally recovered, the car had been modified by Driggars and Gilbert so that it could no longer be driven, but it was still usable as a toy. Over the course of several months, the dogs used the car in a variety of ways. They were able to crawl in and out, stand on its table and sniff the inside. They could have sat on the dashboard, but since it was a toy it was disused and moved around the house a lot. After the project was finished, Driggars and Gilbert decided to work together",

In her recent projects, Shetkovsky toys with the machinery of the advertising and marketing industries, using images of helpless dolls to explore the construction of female bodies in relation to male dominance in society. She likes to see her work as a commentary on \u2018the language of advertising\u2019, adding: \u2018I think of advertising as the writing of the first chapter of Naqoyq\u2019, a literary magazine in Bangladesh.\u2019 Her documentary videos, photographs and stories use the language of photography and graphic photography to examine the subtle language of marketing, the representations that appear on",

This has manifested in works such as Doc\u2019\u2019s Waterfall (2004), a massive sculptural installation featuring eighty-six cast iron raised flood gates designed to stop water from overflowing into the Tisbury Plain. Other projects include Wet Blankets (2005), an ambitious ninety-day programme of paintings, drawings, collages and video that brings together andrefrigerated material from across history to create a single vast painting.

Once inside the pan the jewellery melts and the pan is ritually purified. The process often takes place over several months, with thousands of tiny mirrors (10cm or less) scattered around the Temple of Solomon in Liverpool. Each mirror represents a different letter of the alphabet, and the gemstone is polished to a mirror-like surface. Once the mirror images are created and arranged in the appropriate order, the body of the composition is cast into the surrounding earth, on obelisks, rooftop walkways, pavement or cobblestone. The resulting film is a slow burn, brilliantly colourful film that plays with the very",

Much of his work uses the format of the video or cinematics to reflect on the social and political conundrums of the contemporary world.  \n\tThe Cold Worlds of My Dad (1995) is a five-screen installation consisting of three video projections depicting a series of family photographs. Each video image is slightly distorted so as to make out the words \u2018my dad\u2019 and \u2018the others\u2019 in the family portrait. The video also includes special effects that make quick work of the typically subtle processes involved in photo family portraits. \n\tThe films radiate the kind of powerful, unbridled force you might",
        "Leivi Kreiner (b. 1973, Bhach\u0101u, India) lives and works in Vancouver, Canada. Kreiner takes a deep-time perspective towards artistic production by taking over abandoned warehouses and distilling them into unique, technologically advanced, and environmentally benign art projects. She takes this on, in part, because she finds it psychologically satisfying to wrest control of her own imagery, and in part, it is because it allows her to address fundamental, and often taboo, issues pertaining to the creation of culturally responsive artwork. Kreiner utilizes vicious dichotomy in both her personal and work life. She chooses to operate in the public domain by remaining silent, and choosing to communicate her anxieties and fears via her hyper-violent imagery rather than via her often used metaphor of the pickaxe. \n\tReetu S",

Haubert\u2019s practice spans a wide range of media, from paper collage to performative sculpture and large-scale video, and often uses of these works is based on historical information that is both speculative and/or inaccurate. His multisensory, hybrid regimes of narrative creation are explored with a focus on memory and perception. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016 Haubert presents Valeskaitek, a work that included a newly commissioned video installation incorporating elements of film and television.

Since the late 1980s, Defenbaugh\u2019s practice has been more concerned with the relationship between observation and memory, and interactive art and literature. His dramatic and politically charged films, photographs, drawings and multiple projection narratives are sequences of events from past and present history recounted with multiple timelines. The choreographed timelines are fantastical \u2013 complete with double takes, heartbeats and breathing, just as the events themselves are. Transformative works such as Panacea of Dreams (1998) imagined a utopian future in which the forces of nature (i.e. naturality) were fully countered.

He has developed projects such as Punk.Visions.Ruin (1999) \u2013 a huge billboard project replacing every street in New York with the images and slogans of punk bands. In Liverpool, Mihelich has built a new \u2018reality TV\u2019 \u2013 forming around the thriving punk scene there.

By capturing fleeting fleeting moments of extreme colour and intensity he evokes the intense blues and yellows of Puritan America\u2019s New World. In his series of poetics, the Image of Love (1998), he captured the intensity of religious belief and personal experience in the intense reality of everyday life. People of faith (known in India as bhakts) are passionate about their beliefs, their practices and their beliefs\u2019, and often insert special aesthetic or political judgments into such experience.

Her images are at once real and fallacious: they are colorful, yet deceptive: they are saturated, yet questionable: they are flat, yet provocative: they are luxurious yet sinister: they hover, yet alienating. Her poetics counterposes concepts of hara (false) and kara (false) meaning, and the ways in which clothing can both convey and conceal. For example, she photographed a crowded Tokyo subway wearing a colorful dress that hid a crease made by the curve of her jacket. Yet her powerful image shows that even in the presence of such precision it is impossible to escape the irresistible pull of the oppressive flow of the subway carriage itself. \n",

By subtly modifying a particular word, shape, or image into a different form, he has managed to project himself into 'that' world. Equally, he has appropriated the traits and modes of production that are specific to a particular culture or community and made them part of a larger arsenal of subversive and dystopian possibilities. Theologically speaking, Bodenhamer\u2019s work embiggens the gap between fiction and reality.

        " The biennial should turn down offers of hospitality that have been made to critics with whom the Liverpool community is associated.  The Next Liverpool Biennial should be responsive to the local context and the authority\u2019s ability to engage with the city and its citizens. In a city where art and culture thrive, it is vital that the Next Liverpool Biennial reflects the diversity of communities and cultures.  The Next Liverpool Biennial will offer local artists and curators the chance to experiment with innovative, site-specific work and engage the public. It will also host artists as well as visitors who may not otherwise have been able to participate in the biennial.  The biennial is anchored in the Liverpool city region and will expand to other cities in the UK and internationally. Liverpool is a city with a rich history. It was the first city to be settled after the Norman Conquest in 1066 and, for much of its history, it has been a working-class area. In 1066, the castle was renamed Liverpool and in 1440, the town was involved in the infamous Sessions of Anne Boleyn. In 1997, the town celebrated its thirtieth birthday.  In 1066, the Earls of Liverpool were appointed earls by the Normans in 1066, and twenty years later, the town celebrated its hundredth birthday.

        "   The concept of the Liverpool Biennial was conceived by the Liverpool Biennial Trust in 1984 while the redevelopment of the old Liverpool Ship Dock was under way. The Trust\u2019s aim was to utilise the biennial as a temporary phenomenon to attract people to the city and region. In time the biennial became a regular event attracting artists, groups of artists, curators, journalists and the public.  The Liverpool Biennial has attracted more than 230,000 people to the city and region, displaying the vibrant contemporary artwork of Miwa Yanagi, Okuwa and Asahina.  The Liverpool Biennial has established itself as a major event in the international calendar of recurring art exhibitions. It has also received international recognition, including the Order of Australia's prestigious Order of Merit.  In Australia, the 1st Liverpool Biennial was held at the Liverpool Art Gallery in 1991. The exhibition was renowned for its comprehensive range and for its presentation of major new and emerging artists. The exhibition featured the work of nearly 2000 artists, from Australia and around the world, with artists such as Gillian Wearing, Chris Marker, Mark Wallinger, Ken Lum, Mari Okada, Tom Z\u00e9, Olaf Nicolai, and Alison Wright.  The following year\u2019s exhibition featured the work of nearly 1600 artists, with works from Japan, Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome, Turkey, Korea, Italy and USA.

        "   The next Liverpool Biennial will not just be a celebration of art, it should also have a social aspect, meaning that Liverpool will play a key role in promoting and securing the future of the arts here at home. There has to be a connection between the past and the future, and Liverpool has to be the right place to find it.  The first Liverpool Biennial featured artists from beneath the surface, with works commissioned by the bands and individuals who have contributed to the development of Liverpool in recent years. These sessions explored what it means to be a local, to be a citizen and to take part in society. Some twenty-five years ago, this activity might well have been considered distasteful, but as street art and other forms of cultural appropriation have become more obvious, the connection has become more direct.  The first Liverpool Biennial, commissioned by the Liverpool Philharmonic in 1990, explored the relationship between the music and the visual arts. Works by Andy Goldsworthy, Cornelia Parker and Harry Houdini explored the bond between music and art, between visual culture and local culture. Innsbruck International followed in 1992, with artists including Niekola Rasputin, Christian Boltanski, Jean-Christoph Ammann, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. The following year the festival expanded to New York and Canada, with artists including  Gabi Ngcobo, Kwangsu Kim, and Ranjit Hoskote.

In other words, the Liverpool Biennial should make no bones about its intention to go where no one has gone before, and to go where no one has gone since the Second World War.  It should invent its own language, borrowing phrases and concepts from across the city\u2019s history, and using them to the benefit of the art community as a whole.

I believe that it is very difficult to imagine a future for the 27 members of the European Union without the full cooperation of the other members of the bloc. If we do not do everything possible to keep them together, then they will not survive.
