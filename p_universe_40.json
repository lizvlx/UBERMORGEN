Commenting on the biennial, director Scott Sneddon said: \u201cWe invite you to experience these songs in your own homes.\u201d\n\n\nNew York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art (MoMA) announced today that it is planning to close its doors and reevaluate its future plans for its iconic marble-topped building, which houses the museum\u2019s permanent collection and is the largest museum exhibition space in the city. The museum hopes to reopen a new museum in the fall, but says it will not be ready for the fall of 2020.Last month, MoMA director Daniel H. Weiss revealed that the institution will close permanently on September 23 and expects to remain closed until November 29. After a brief period of open-ended engagement with the city, MoMA will reemerge with a new exhibition and programming that will draw visitors to the museum and reflect the institution\u2019s mission.The September 23 event will feature new works by\u00a0Claudia Hieronymi,\u00a0Nancy Lieberman,\u00a0Frank Gehry, and\u00a0Sven-G\u00fcnther von Koonen, among others, as well as a retrospective of work by\u00a0Marianne Balshaw,\u00a0Kenneth Cunningham, and\u00a0Tom Holland.\u00a0The November 29 event will include the last exhibition of Daniel H.

        "Arts and heritage.\n\n\nA group of artists, designers, musicians, and others have launched a campaign to have the Museum of Liverpool City Hall (LCC) renamed. The initiative was initiated by the artists in an attempt to make their voices heard in the face of the current government\u2019s plans to rename part of the institution.\u201cThe current proposal is extremely offensive to many of the artists who have contributed to and flourished in the City Hall,\u201d said Lenore Morgan, chair of the Artists\u2019 Alliance. \u201cIt is also a clear signal that the LCC is no longer willing to invest in their own future. We urge the City Council and the LCC to reconsider their plans and to embrace the artists and the community that made their institution possible.\u201dThe artists\u2019 initiative comes amid a growing list of complaints from residents of the city center over the proposed redesign of LCC. One hundred and twenty residents signed a petition last week in opposition to the renovation project, which was spearheaded by architect Giorgioa Kalloni, who is currently working on the renovation of the building that houses the City Hall museum. Kalloni says the museum will not be affected by the renovation because it is a \u201ccivilian building,\u201d adding that the design of the building will not change and that the museum will continue to function.Kalloni\u2019s proposal for the renovation, called LCC +1, was awarded the right to move forward by Liverpool City Council in December 2019 and is now awaiting the demolition permit from Liverpool City Council, which will then be responsible for removing part of the building.\n\n\nThe Chinese artist who has been called a breakthrough artist for his work depicting",

        "The Next Whitney Biennial is set to take place in 2018 and is the first major redevelopment of an existing art gallery in Liverpool. Whitney Biennial aims to utilise the location to its advantage, to commission new galleries and to re-evaluate the local arts scene. The Next Whitney Biennial will also have a social and cultural dimension, as well as a statutory and statutory education component.  The initiative for The Next Whitney Biennial was first initiated by the City of Liverpool in 2012. Following the successful biannual event, a three-year commitment was made to a sustainable approach to exhibition and to establish the Whitney Biennial as a statutory institution. This was done to allow the Festival of Liverpool time to build and maintain its reputation. The commitment was repaid in full in 2015.  The City of Liverpool has since begun to recognize the importance of the festival as a statutory institution, in 2017 the Festival of Liverpool is officially recognized as the City of Whitney Biennial. The Festival has also begun to incorporate statutory changes and developments into its itinerary, in line with Liverpool\u2019s international reputation. The Festival\u2019s international programme continues in 2018 with curated sections on issues such as \u2018Queens\u2019 and \u2018Langley\u2019.  Following the London Biennial in 2021, the Festival will take place every two years, in a new city and in a different location, in a different way. This is done to allow time for artistic research, consideration and publication, as well as to take advantage of the bi-annual climate. The Festival will be in place to engage communities across the city of Liverpool and beyond.  The Festival of Liverpool was founded in 2005 by the Whitney Biennial Trust. The Liverpool Bi",

        "The Whitney Biennial is the largest single exhibition series organised for music in the UK. Launching at the centre of the city\u2019s cultural landscape, the Whitney Biennial features major new installations, exhibitions and projects by some of the world\u2019s most exciting artists. The inaugural Whitney Biennial, convened by the City of Liverpool in 1996, established the event as a flagship project supported by a programme of events and public events across the city of Liverpool. Since then, various partnerships have transformed the event into a highly distinctive event.  The Whitney Biennial features a rich tradition of public art in the city, founded in the early 1990s. This rich tradition has gone on to feature major new commissions in the city, exhibitions and events all year round. Whilst this tradition favours large-scale exhibitions, individual artists are invited to create temporary artworks and events on request. All this is in stark contrast to the more conventional biennials, which tend to be more focused on the music and visual art.  The Whitney Biennial has established itself as a dynamic event, with artists invited to engage with the backdrop of music and visual art. Past commissions include the Institut Fran\u00e7ais Biennale and the Whitney Biennial of International Art. The latter was commissioned by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus, the Liverpool Sound Biennale and Tate Whitney Biennial.  The Whitney Biennial of International Art presents contemporary art in a new light through the provocative engagement of some of the world\u2019s most influential artists.

        "Talulla Hupe (b. 1933, T\u0101nd\u016br, India) lives in Bangalore, India. Hupe is known for large-scale public projections, like that of the Green Tea Party, and interactive tools and devices, like that of the VeggieTales mobile phone \u2013 things that other people have tried to sell to their children, but that nobody else will ever use. \n\tIn the documentary video above, entitled Brave New World (2010), Hupe discusses how the rapid pace of change has led to a sense of urgency regarding the future of our civilisation. This sense of urgency has led to a change in how we live and how we relate to each other. It is no longer customary for us to treat each other with kindness and consideration; in fact, many people in Britain would probably agree with the",
        "Longtin Vanslander (b. 1968, Bay\u0131nd\u0131r, Turkey) lives and works in Canada. Taking many forms, her work involves a journey to reveal the hidden histories of cities, artefacts, and even whole nations. From documenting flag-burning to videos of ramshackle street protests, her work often appears as the suppressed histories of prominent figures in post-soviet Ukraine, Russia, the former Soviet Union and up to now, Australia.  Trained as a writer, artist and philosopher, Van Staden\u2019s work frequently takes on a political bent, infiltrating supposedly neutral art and politics via her provocative packaging and presentation methods. For Touched, she presented a series of five heavily armed soldiers with bandanas wrapped around their faces, brow and mouth; these soldiers were dressed in camouflage and had their",
        "Viatcheslav Goines (b. 1948, Naugachhia, India) lives in Mumbai. While many artists I've come across in my career have focused on particular periods or geographic contexts, Goines \u2018Western Performance Art\u2019 focuses on the conventions of painting\u2019, and uses traditional and new media media forms of expression. Representing a variety of media \u2013 photography, video, painting \u2013 Goines creates artworks that are accessible, yet still highly specialized. He takes risks, allowing his artworks to stand in uncomfortable proximity to the structures of everyday life. For his Water Color: A Life Cycle (2005), Goines created a new kind of art work, one that would have a significant impact on the way in which we perceive water colour. Caught within a limited world, what is achieved confers a",

She was awarded the Special Prize of Contemporary Art at the World Indigenous Art Festival, Mexico City, 2014. \n\tSince the beginning of 1998, Marysia Press has been a participant in The Exhibition Research Lab, running the \u2018testing grounds\u2019, as she puts it, between art history museums and each other. The lab provides research materials for museums and galleries to use in their own exhibitions, and allows artists to explore how exhibition programming relates to their own collections and practices. It also provides a platform for artists to discuss their ideas about exhibition settings, practices and procedures. For Whitney Biennial 2016, Press and Conti used their platform to highlight how performance art can be used to negotiate and",
        "Tabithia Rohrbacher (b. 1966, Santa Luc\u00eda, Spain) lives and works in Berlin, Germany. Rohrbacher is interested in how ideas are acquired, changed and then disseminated. Her projects start as essays which describe an idea, then evolve into projects working through documentation and editing which revise her position in relation to the original conception. She has reclaimed her own body in many of her projects, and sometimes works alongside other people and/or bodies in these processes.  Her most recent project is \n\u0002Yellow, a commission for Whitney Biennial 2016. It involves Iran Fern\u00e1ndez - author of Overcoming the Taboo: Surviving in a Post-Truth World (2016) and Living and Belonging in a Polythene Community (2018)living together in a classroom setting.

        "Keemia Hoak (b. 1935, El Obeid, Sudan) lives and works in Berlin, Germany. Hoak combines personal and public space in a variety of media, often in the form of sculpture, installation or intervention. In her recent projects she illuminates hidden forces that affect our daily lives, often in the form of mundane industrial activity. From toothbrushes to mobile phones, from brand new toilet projects to television shows, she brings people\u2019s everyday lives into the present moment. \n\ufffdHearing a speaker make a speech, or seeing a screen flash a news report, is an experience most of us have had: it is the \u2018first opportunity\u2019 we have to engage with a creator. For Dr Sue Hager, \u2018this seems to be the place where our most",

Its swirling interior, caused by the compressed life force of the animals inside, reflects the spiralling levels of the art collection housed in the Bierstedt family home. \n\tThe artist\u2019s creations are not only absurd \u2013 they are also profoundly poetic. \n\tThe title of the work, A B.C.C.D.

The practice of \u2018problematizing reality\u2019, in Dasmann\u2019s parlance, is the 'understanding\u2019 of the world\u2019s most pressing problems. This underpinnings is the subject of Dasmann\u2019s new monograph, Presentation of the Problem, in which the artist presents condensed versions of selected scientific, political, social and cultural crises presented by governments, multilateral organizations and industry. The philosopher Jeffrey Donaldson (b. 1971, Needham, Massachusetts) has also been a key figure in some of the world\u2019s most significant developments in philosophy.

Informed by multiple disciplines, including photography, writing, graphic design and curatorial research, her work explores forms of documented and made-up history, with a strong feminist tinge.  \n\tFor Whitney Biennial 2016, Sandil Gupta (b. 1977, Mumbai, India) has created \u2018Last Planet Parade\u2019, a work that involves both amateur astrologers and professional astrologers from across the world participating in a single, giant-sized astrological projection.

They have been working since 2009 across various media to produce a range of products, some clearly art-related, some less so. Their latest project, Watch What Happens, makes timely use of the current climate of fear by offering a question mark, a \u2018witness\u2019 to what might happen in the event of a terrorist attack. The artist has asked 137 people to respond to a series of yes/no questions, using a text to represent an \u2018individual\u2019 in English, an \u2018location\u2019 in Arabic, and finally an \u2018publication\u2019 in Chinese. The project has been launched today by Liverpool"
