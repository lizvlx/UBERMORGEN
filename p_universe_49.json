        "Dauson Hurde (b. 1970, Tai Po, Hong Kong) is an artist living and working in San Francisco, USA. His piece for MADE UP entitled Arbores Laetae (Joyful Trees) expresses gratitude towards those who have shaped and stay the same in the tradition of the indigenous peoples of Australia. This work is part of an Indigenous Australian Art World Show featuring 40 brightly coloured, tied together bundles of native trees newly planted in locations across the city. \n\tHurde\u2019s Arbores Laetae situates gratitude towards those who have shaped and stay the same in the tradition of the indigenous peoples of Australia.

        "Dauson Goforth (b. 1966, Tai Po, Hong Kong) has cultivated a system of blending in amongst the locals, creating a virtual art world presence that is intensely \u2018personal\u2019 in order to accommodate for the territory taken for granted by the authorities \u2013 a status exemplified by the \u2018Welcome Station\u2019 sign that is literally a slot created by removing the border between Ireland and Scotland, and replacing it with a decorative plaque in Belfast City Hall. In his installation for MADE UP entitled Glitter (2008), Goforth changed the rules of engagement for border security in Belfast by seamlessly combining the visual with the physical. The sculpture drew the visitor\u2019s attention to a paradoxical tool for controlling access to the inside of the city: Glitter - a permanent, brightly coloured border. While glo",
        "Dauson Robotham (b. 1974, Tai Po, Hong Kong) has been creating artworks ever since he was a child. Although heavily influenced by nature, his work still retains a human touch through the gentle manipulation of natural forces.  \n\tFor Touched, Robotham employed a variety of naturalistic plant-based materials in creating a new mosaic called The Bonsai Effect. Made from natural materials including rice husk, tamarind leaves, cotton, sheep's wool, pine needles and aconite clay, the work is poised between life and art. It was created with the aim of teaching young people \u2018respect\u2019 and \u2018discipline\u2019 while also examining their \u2018emotional stability\u2019. The artist explained: \u2018This work can have a profound personal impact",

As a Cub Scout, Beardsley was an active leader within a small group of individuals who have become known as the Daughters of the Trail. Their mission statement for almost 400 years was to 'do to the land what was done to the people of the land.' Their legacy lives in rewriting laws and policies in an attempt to make sense of the confusing and shifting definitions of these changed rules.  Dogs do not bark at the sight of death \u2013 not even when faced with the threat of physical violence. When faced with an intruder in their midst, the Daughters of the Trail would not have hesitated to use their bare hands to roughly subdue and then subdue the intruder. In life, they were",
        "Dauson Larocco (b. 1995, Tai Po, Hong Kong) lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan. Neal Koum\u2019s work more broadly embraces the notion of calligraphy, public sculpture, iconography and mixed reality. Using performed actions and gestures, his sometimes surreal and intensely nuanced artistic ideas can be seen to address key issues of the post-mortem, the terminus m' ervice, inequality in society and other areas. \n\tIn recent solo exhibitions Leckey presented decisions making through symbiotic and entwined processes, where different groups of people benefited or suffered as a result of the choices and actions of other people within the group. The projects in this series include Skin Colour: A Living Lode of Skin (Mackay), Self Portrait: A Walk in",

When he invents a new word, a new way of life, a new way of thinking, a new way of being able to express himself or herself then he appropriates the existing social and political structures of a city and makes them his own. The artist uses the existing language of billboards, magazine advertisements, train announcements, and street names to create a buzz, which he then distorts and changes the vocabulary to his own advantage. Nanoo invents new words and phrases by using advertisements as a starting point. He calls these phrases \u2018brand new\u2019 or \u2018inventionals\u2019, and uses word games \u2013 elimination and",

Tai Po has been producing artworks under the collective title TWENTIETH [\u96f6] since 2009. These works explore the ethical and political ambiguity of the use of art resources, and the relationship between the local and globalised economy. \n\tBelow are some examples of works made on canvas using an technique developed by Seattle-based artist Rebecca Moritz (b.1975, Washington State University) for her installations: Headcase (1998), developed with artist Terry Richardson; Subterranea (2005), developed with artist David Reinfurt; and Event Horizon (2008), developed with artist David Reinfurt. \n\tContaining statues",

The surfaces she explores are drawn from various social, political and cultural contexts that are always evolving, changing and eroding \u2013 in the unlikely event that they ever actually maturing. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016 Susko has created MODERN PLANET, a large-scale architectural surface which takes over an entire side garden of a derelict 1920s farmhouse in Merseyside, UK, and grows into a fully-fledged urban plant.

        "Dauson Burrow (b. 1945, Tai Po, Hong Kong) has deployed an array of sculptural materials over the last half century to create works of art. His key achievement is his 'plastic mill' \u2013 a huge, open, circular space which divides the former fuel tankers shed into three, so that they can be viewed from different angles. This also allows the artist to view the inner workings of the building from different perspectives. The sculptural \u2018machine\u2019 is a powerful tool for connecting individuals and communities, but it suffers from a serious deficiency in our use of it: being used, it loses its shape and means.

He is interested in the art of archiving, the aesthetic as much as the practical, and in the similarities and differences between the symbolic and real. Through research into the archives of Liverpool universities and archives in France, as well as my own collecting, I have expanded my interest in conceptually connected art forms and erased the phases of conceptual art. \n\tWhen I was in school we used to have a programme called The Project Yearbook, in which students presented their achievements in applied mathematics, science and technology.

In his art practice, \u2018content\u2019 predominates, and the artist is particularly interested in societal issues such as anxiety, loss and the permeability of experience. The artist works in video, printmaking, photography and installation. He constructs narratives that are at odds with the overwhelming majority of his work, resulting in bizarre hybrid arrangements involving puppets, subservient medication bottles, burnt-out cars and a children\u2019s hospital. \n\tFor International 04 Calegari collaborated with Michael Ming (b.1964, Beijing, China) and Jeffrey Yu (b.1974, Shanghai, China) to produce a multi-sensory installation entitled ",

Stefan\u2019s practice spans a wide range of media, from paper collage to performative sculpture, video and installation, and includes situations as diverse as drawing animals at night in an attempt to capture their visual states in the daytime, and presiding over empty classrooms during lunch hour. His multi-sensory environments suggest an imaginative mapping of the personality as embodied by the campus custodian, the nervous system controller and the academic administrator. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016, Dauson has recreated an ancient Greek theatre built for Dionysus playing Neoplatonic tragedies on amphitheatre stages.

In \u2018Making the Grade\u2019 (2006), Mckim executed a documentary film exploring the history of hip-hop in Liverpool, Australia, juxtaposing it with the city\u2019s current gentrification. The film followed Mckim\u2019s mother as she moved from Australia to Liverpool to pursue \u2018education\u2019. This journey, part environmental, part philosophical, part spiritual journey, marked a shift in Mckim\u2019s mother\u2019s thinking.

His ongoing The Dauson Project (2012-16) consists of the re-emergence of a population allegedly mysteriously disappearing over a five year period: the Disappeared. The Disappeared was established as a photographic archive in 1997 by Lise Eliot and John Leavitt, members of the Tate Team. It was preceded by a series of video recordings made by the artists in 2002, which have been downloaded more than 38 million times. \n\tDauson Oldfather\u2019s new film for Liverpool Biennial 2016, \n\tLooking Glass (2016), presents a radical reimagining of the mechanism of archiving",

The text of the paintings is as enigmatic as they are mesmerising. Performing the Quell is the intellectual and imaginative means through which the artists bring to the fore the underlying concepts underlying the production of these illusory constructions. The title of the piece, a portmanteau of the French words 'pointe' and 'courte' (a borrowing from the language of the Performing The Quell), encapsulates the complex relationship these artists have had throughout",

His practice revolves around the appropriation of the 'fourth wall' by explicitly reappropriating the constructed by conventions of interaction between the self and the outside world, and the eventualisation of a world of autonomous third-person narratives. Taking direct aim at conventions of interaction, his playful reclaimance of the built is often based upon actual events, Zenn\u2019i\u2019s 'walled city\u2019 or policed zone'.

While exploring various media for his investigations into the sensory side-effects of digital media, Makhoul also looks to photography for his insights into what happens when aesthetic sensibility overwhelms critical thought.

In his collaborative piece with young people from Liverpool for International 06, Cange invited 28 people from the Burs School at the University of Arts to attend a party at his flat. This was a very restricted use of public space, and there were strict limits imposed by law: no photography, video or sound.

The pavilion was constructed in 1906 to celebrate Italian modernism and to provide space for a retrospective of two earlier works, a collaboration with the artist \u00celina Al\u00ffs of the Pop/Post-Modern movement of 1964 and a retrospective of the new contemporary art of the 1970s.Renzo Piano, the Italian architect whose three-decade career encompassed many genres, including Earth/Air, Architecture, and Special Effects, will lead the\u00a0\u201cPeru\u201d (Peru, Italy) Pavilion at the Venice Biennale.

The future of Britain\u2019s architecture at large and the future of architecture in general, must therefore involve a greater articulation of the values that underlie modernism and the ways in which architecture can address the aspirations of different times and different places.\u201d\n\n\nA panel of five artists\u2014Cindy Sherman, Alice A. McKee, C\u00e9cile B. Pe\u00f1a, Maximilian Richter, and James S. Preston\u2014was convened by the National Museum of American Art (MoA) in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, June 8, to discuss the revitalization of the Beaux Arts museum, which has been closed since September 11, 2001, and the future of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).The panel\u2014which also included Deborah Ross Brown, the director of the Seattle Art Museum, and Mark Sobey, the founder of the art-world marketing company Smart Media Design\u2014spoke about the museum\u2019s work in the 1990s and its current partnership with the Seattle-based nonprofit Center for Contemporary Art Seattle, the Denny Dimin Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\u201cWe have had a long-term partnership with the Beaux Arts museum for more than twenty years, and it has greatly expanded our ability to present a significant wealth of contemporary art to Seattle,\u201d said Diana Seroussi, chair of the panel. \u201cThe Beaux Arts\u2019s work in the 1990s is very much a product of its time and the shifting landscapes for artists, but it is also a migration story, and one that has been told through a body of work that speaks to and recalls all of us.\u201dIn order to preserve the",

The six-month residency will culminate in a work-travel exhibition at the museum in October 2020.The selection committee will be chaired by Nell Doran, director of Tate Britain, and will select the honorees in November.

        " Liverpool Biennial 2020 will be the first in a new series of public art exhibitions that will see present day practitioners engage with and reflect on spooky, unorthodox and experimental entertainment beyond the art object. Source: www.thenextlewimsbiennial.com  <ENDOFTEXT> The Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary Art is focusing on international current affairs, global restructuring, and crises that affect men and their environment.   The The State Museum of Contemporary Art with the support of the Ministry of Culture of Greece organized the 1st Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary Art in 2007. The aim of this initiative by the Ministry of Culture was, amongst other, to place Thessaloniki and Greece in the international network of contemporary art biennials.  A number of parameters have shaped the identity of the Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary Art. The fact that Thessaloniki is far from the European centers of art distribution (such as sponsors, companies and private persons investing in contemporary art) gives the Biennale the freedom to encourage and attract new avant-garde ideas and eventually contribute to the actual development of art, not to its recycling. It also makes public \u2013 on the European art scene \u2013 art works that offer new aesthetic proposals which are both bold and daring, with the intention of boosting aesthetic and social dialogue.  The Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary Art is focusing on international current affairs, global restructuring, and crises that affect men and their environment. By forming ties with existing art institutions in Europe and elsewhere, the Biennale aims to encourage further artistic exchange.  The Biennale communicates with artists from different geographic regions and presents the work of",

        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial should include a focus on \u2018spooky\u2019 as it is a term that describes works that scare the shit out of people. That means work that excites the shit out of people, but doesn\u2019t scare the shit out of people just yet. There are many ways to approach this approach, but the basic idea is to frighten people off using the word\u2019sPROSHOCK\u2019 as a synonym for horror.  Instead, the Next Liverpool Biennial should be about more than just spooky music and scary films. It should be about ideas, about moving forward, about moving forward, and about moving forward in Liverpool. It should be about creativity, about coming up with ideas, about tapping into the creativity of others, and about contributing to the creativity of others. It should be about public access to art and creative projects, and public engagement in and out of the Liverpool Art Gallery. It should be about the role of the arts and cultural institutions, and the role of young people and young adult artists. It should be about the role of the arts and cultural institutions, and the role of young people and young adult artists.

        "   The Next Liverpool Biennial should include a narrative unfolding across a series of increasingly cosy liaisons, encounters and collaborations on a wide range of matters, in both public and private spaces, in preparation for a public event.  The Next Liverpool Biennial should operate in both the public realm and the private sector, and in locations across the city. The choice of sites will be influenced by the sites selected, and the character of the proposed event, but will hopefully provide a stimulating framework for ongoing discussions in the city and beyond.  The Next Liverpool Biennial will be a significant undertaking in the making, and we are excited about the prospects for the project. We have identified several areas where the public can get involved, and where local, national and international artists can be found working with the public. These areas have been identified to act as staging areas for major future events, and we are excited to have the confidence to partner with them for the exciting projects ahead.  The Next Liverpool Biennial will be a learning project in preparation for a larger event, and we are delighted to be able to offer lessons and seminars to help budding artists grow as they go. These should provide stimulating opportunities for both classroom and seminar use, and for practitioners to deepen their understanding of contemporary art.  The project has an international component, and we are excited to be able to offer lessons and seminars to help budding artists grow as they go. These should provide stimulating opportunities for both classroom and seminar use, and for practitioners to deepen their understanding of contemporary art.
