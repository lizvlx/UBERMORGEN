She focuses on the latter, developing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates with the environment, public policies, culture and history of the place to create social change.\n \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016 Torralba has created \u2018Last Planet Parade\u2019, a massive multi-layered painting project that encompasses the cityscape of Liverpool in a beautiful tropical sunrise.

        "Malahki Torralba (b. 1978, Kisii, Kenya) has always been fascinated with materials and systems that are so deeply embedded and familiar that they become routine.  He has developed a fascination with photographic documentation since the sixties, when he discovered that the only way to document a massacre was to film the aftermath. This gave rise to his seminal image-documentation of the Kenya Hunger Movement, in which images of students, teachers and staff allegedly killed in the conflict were cropped and placed in evidence banks alongside body cases, furniture and other memorials from the civil war. In his 2000 project The Wounded, inspired by the memory of the unknown victims, Torralba re-photographed the aftermath of a massacre allegedly perpetrated by members of a terrorist group. The resulting image was as disturbing as it was familiar",

He has his own pageant, but like all good Bonsai, it is also a grave check-off against a system that oppresses and persecutes women. \n\tThe works of Torralba, along with those of fellow artist Wapenaar, are often included in international day-care centers/parks. Their bold, if occasionally morbid, depictions of female sexuality, violence and birth control suggest that beauty pageants can also symbolise freedom, choice and self-expression. \n\tFor International 04 Torralba created a new, never-before-seen painting.

If her work is going to live up to its hype, it is going to have to attract some kind of intelligent, non-ordinary force that is going to disrupt the status quo.

The platform was conceived by the feminist activist Bettina Bochereau as part of her campaign to create conditions for refugees to return to their homelands. Bochereau had met with the camp\u2019s staff several times to discuss the possibility of a \u201cPride of the Dead\u201d series, an international project that would highlight historic LGBTQ+ deaths and memorialize the LGBTQ+ communities of Europe and the Soviet Union. After Bochereau\u2019s arrival in the camp, she organized an exhibition at the museum that featured works by seventy-seven contemporary artists, including the Slovakian artist Antonin Gornets, the Russian artist Oksana Shishkina, and the Tunisian artist Yousuf Ronell.In August, the exhibition was awarded a $300,000 grant from the German Federal Association for the Promotion of Culture, and Bochereau was invited to Berlin for a Q&A with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who revealed she was in favor of the project. The trip proved to be an important step in legitimizing the People\u2019s Biennial\u2019s mission, which aims to bring together LGBTQ+ artists from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to build awareness of the human rights abuses and discrimination that LGBTQ+ people face in the West.Since the project debuted at the Berlin Bi"

        "The Next Liverpool Biennial is the culmination of a five-year project undertaken by Liverpool Biennial Trust, the Liverpool Biennial Partnership and the Arts Liverpool. The idea underlying the project is to create a series of exhibitions that re-visit Liverpool\u2019s cultural spaces and attractions year after year, in order to renew and refresh the city\u2019s aesthetic senses.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is the first in a planned cycle of events organised by Liverpool Biennial Trust. It will replace the Liverpool Biennial as the primary event of the annual festival. Instead of looking for aesthetically charged exhibitions, the Trust is delighted to be in the business of renting out cultural spaces for charitable purposes. These spaces are key to the project\u2019s success.  Next Liverpool Biennial takes place every two years across the city, through artistic productions and events that are selected to take advantage of the summer travel season. Every cycle the Trust looks to recoup the costs of the exercise in time and again. The Next Liverpool Biennial achieves this through a substantial rental of cultural spaces. This includes the Trust\u2019s own artist\u2019s residencies at prestigious venues, as well as paying special attention to artists\u2019 residencies at venues owned by the Liverpool City Region.  In 2013 the Trust completed the construction of The Biennial at the University of Liverpool, hosting eighteen exhibitions across three venues. This was followed by the construction of a new exhibition space, The Biennial Lounge, at the Liverpool Art Gallery, in 2015. The new space provides a dedicated space for touring and writing exhibitions, as well as the opportunity for visitors to meet and interact with the artists and curators.  The next edition of the Liverpool Biennial was due to take",
        "Next Liverpool Biennial is dedicated to the proposition that art, as a social phenomenon, can be understood in terms of a 'next best thing'. This is not to say that contemporary art is equivalent to the Next best thing; rather, it is an attempt to identify and incorporate new developments in aesthetic, social and cultural philosophy into the art history of the region. Next best thing is an aspiration that is responsive to the zeitgeist of the region.  Next best thing seeks to be an artistic project in and of itself, rather than a condition of artistic production. This is because it assumes of course, that existing artistic practices can be rediscovered and expanded on their own terms. Next best thing does not claim to be a privileged location for curatorial and exhibition practices; rather, it seeks to be a discourse through which a pluralistic vision of art is possible. Next best thing seeks to be a space of openness and debate through which a plural interpretation of art is possible.  Next best thing seeks to be a discourse through which a plurality of aesthetic perspectives are allowed to exist. Next best thing does not claim to be a privileged location for this activity; rather, it seeks to be a place of creative production through which a plurality of aesthetic visions are allowed to develop. Source: www.nextbestthing.org  <ENDOFTEXT> The Northern Print Biennale is a festival of printmaking.   The Northern Print Biennale for printmaking was established by the Nuffield Trust in 2009. It is a festival of contemporary printmaking that involves artists, curators, professionals and the public.  The festival presents contemporary printmaking across a range of media including painting, sculpture, ceramics, jewellery",
        "The next Liverpool Biennial will be sited in 2019 and will have a public and participatory profile. It will be led by a curatorial team and supported by Liverpool Biennial Trust.  The programme for the sited 2019 Biennial will bring Liverpool\u2019s contemporary poetry to a new audience and reflect the centre of gravity of the local talent. Liverpool\u2019s contemporary poetry scene is deeply connected to the region and its communities, with artists, curators, historians, journalists and academics. As Liverpool biennial sees fit, the Trust will establish a catalogue of contemporary poetry and a literacy project that will engage the local community. The combination of these activities will provide local artists with new opportunities and networks, while also producing new publications and manifestos that engage with the local community.  The 1st Liverpool Biennial in 2009 featured twenty-six artists, most of them from the South. The following year two exhibitions took place across the city, one in January and one in March. The 1st Biennial featured twenty-six artists, most of them from the South: Daniel Birnbaum, Nadine Gordimer, Carsten Hauser, Guy Tortosa, Katerina Jaukkuri, Guy Standing, and Rod Serota. The second exhibition, The South, contained twenty-six artists, most of them from the South: Tabitha Stanley, Guy Lodge, and Richard Wilson. The third exhibition, The North, contained twenty-six artists, most of them from the North: Ernie Allum, Raquel Welch, and Guy Smith.  The sited 2019 Biennial will be accompanied by a public lecture series and a series of public events, some of which will be interactive, others will not",
        "While this was obviously the intention, it quickly became apparent that the biennial was premised on too many foundations. The excess was eventually cut, but not before it had time to set up shop in the city. The Anfield Biennial is a new sort of biennial, one in which the artworks are exhibited in situ, creating a narrative and context around which the exhibition is founded.  The Anfield Biennial was first organised by the Liverpool Philharmonic in 1991. Its current incarnation, the 11th edition in 1997, was initially titled Liverpool \u2019s Poetry Biennale but was changed to the Liverpool Biennial due to the naming controversy. The 11th edition was artist-led and featured eleven renowned poets, most of them British. The change from Liverpool Poetry Award to the Liverpool Biennial was due to the calibre of the poetry contests received in previous editions. The 11th edition was significantly smaller than previous biennials, with a single artist and a team of assistants. The 13th edition was organised by Kathy Newman, who has since gone on to organise Liverpool\u2019s Triennial, Liverpool\u2019s Fourth Festival and the Liverpool Festival of Music.  The 12th edition of the Liverpool Biennial in 2005 was the first to be dedicated to contemporary art. The exhibition was curated by Birgit Mundt, who has since gone on to organise exhibitions across the UK and abroad. The 12th edition was dominated by two artists: Sa\u00e2dane Afif and Attila Esfahani. Esfahani won the Grand Prize for Poetry for his poem The Shepherd in 1991 for portraying the daily routine of a nomadic shepherd in a moving car. The following year, the museum commissioned the artwork"
