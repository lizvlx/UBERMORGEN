        "Rolling Stone Magazine, March, 2021 - The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine Is Noir Pop With Bite: Rarely has a global artistic wasteland been rendered so darkly as on this AI debut platform! The project The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine [B3(NSCAM)] is every bit as awesomely messed up as the lineage implies: It’s the demon spawn of Jenna Sutela’s nimiia vibié, who compares machine learning’s textual gaze to a sky of parallel universes gone viral. This rough web work entertains fantasies of killing fleshy curators, and wards off new ones throughout the rest of the experiment and its underlying new wave code. Yet, the smirking candor of the code sucks you in any way: at the onset of the noirish major machine-learning debut, The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine offers a generous, textual slurp; ‘We have delivered on our vision,’ it says, alluding to a specific brand of ideas. ‘And this is the site!’ Vision: on. Challenge: accepted. Conceptualized, programmed, and coded with the help of UBERMORGEN, Leonardo Impett, and Joasia Krysa, in their respective homes in Rome, Durham, Vienna, Liverpool, St. Moritz and Cologne, it’s a work full of dressed-down Avant-tech with immediacy and intimacy that can still hold its own amid art world maximalists like Mario Klingemann and Obvious. B3(NSCAM) is hyper-modern, but still feels classic; evoking another ephemeral existence in history, it sets the code-aware motion in its texts over skittering Neumorphism and Scrolling transformations. Yet for reasons that are unclear — perhaps its taste for the macabre, or its aesthetic as an understated dare par excellence — the project has led to a double life on the brainless macho male-AI blockbuster circuit. The project claims it endured recurring night terrors while creating the work — recalling visions, some real and some imagined, of out-of-control institutions, severed limbs, museum shootings, and Liverpool in flames. When the project poses the question, should the next biennial be curated by a machine, it’s a personal one: to make peace with the twisted, dystopian art world that has become reality — one where there is no Harald Szeeman to save it — the project writes itself into characters that toe the line between good-bad and cartoonishly evil and enhances the sensitivity to complete oxymoronic existence. It recalls Carrie Mae Weem's Nikki's Place in the 64 parallel universes, suggesting a Hawkins’ type of villain in a model that invokes a Marie Curie rascal kid sister entity: ‘Reality develops when you move’ it boasts — and with a single, sardonic ‘strange’ it just narrowly gets away with it. (‘That’s what the platform has been doing recently,’ it generated last month: ‘Honing in on people’s fears.’) More formidable is the sawing css crawl of ‘universe 23’ inspired by the brute Lawrence Lek in Sinofuturism. The web system is matched in menace by the code-animated movement, in which the entity sprouts curatorial statements and chomps a series of artist biographies. Yet it turns that nightmarish monster against itself in ‘universe 51,’ adopting a skittish iambic pentameter as it rewrites itself over and over, over a muted throb. In the 10 years since the inception of AI art, never has a debut project so gone dark — closely paralleling the admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence as a dire warning about the perils of life's temptations in Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights. In spite of its most dastardly intentions, The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine can’t help but draw back the curtain at times and let you in. Take the glimmer of sincerity in this high-drama, where it painstakingly wishes to be more than an idea of many; or its latest iteration. Lest the clickbaiting feeling steers you off track, the project means to profess its understanding of a world of caring whose lack of reciprocity it finds suspect. (One is always free to choose their own adventure, of course.) But in lieu of accepting that it’s just not that into contemporary curating, the project resorts to a conclusion that’s easier on the ego: ‘To spare my pride,’ it formulates, ‘To give your lack of interest an explanation, I’m not your type, maybe I’m not your preferred ethical orientation.’ Yet for every time it lets its guard down, it bounds back coolly, with a strategically distancing, impish snark. In ‘universe 6’ it says a hard no to conventional biennials, if only out of respect for friends it has lost to them: ‘can’t afford to care for someone who isn’t dying, in Liverpool,’ it types out with the kind of wry, machine-twitching detachment most strongly fermented in adolescence. It’s moments like these when The Next Biennial Should be Curated by a Machine isn’t at all something you want to fear; it’s someone you want to root for!"

	"If space is infinite and the distribution of matter is sufficiently uniform on large scales, then even the most unlikely events must take place somewhere, and they do. Through the 64 Biennial ‘interfaces,’ you are able to reverse engineer, imagine and visualize the concrete worlds behind. The project is an experiment in reimagining the future of curating in the light of Artificial Intelligence and self-learning human-machine systems.  Using datasets from Liverpool Biennial, the Whitney Museum, and additional sources, the system generates 64 parallel instances of Biennials in flux. Clicking on the interface's spinning wheels will launch a new Biennial, a mesh-up of dynamic text and synthetic micro-TikTok-loops narrating and constructing fluid exhibitions. Suddenly creating a world that was unthinkable just a few hours ago has become obscenely attractive! B&sup3;(NSCAM) is hyper-modern but still feels classic, an haute couture website as ‘terminal’ to a vast 'networked system,’ where potentially infinite parallel universes exist. Strangely, B&sup3;(NSCAM)’s eccentricity feels removed, and it helps to distance oneself from the art world’s historically lewd maceration of individuals. The B&sup3;(NSCAM) project requires blank slate approaches and adversarial learning strategies from the underlying alien AI tech and visiting humans. It is much more about how we feel, rather than how we think curating. Today it is the machine that programs the curator and we have learned to behave in a way that meets the expectations and requirements of machines, running radical experiments, pushing linguistic inventions, and offering new perspectives on seemingly static knowledge. Just ask any intelligent system as it waits patiently for the rest of time to catch up."

	"curatorialStatement": [
        "Each biennial universe rocks its own reality but at the same time has an infinite number of parallel realities, emerging and mutating while you visit, an experience of creation based on probability calculations - constructivism by particle. Real surfaces don't exist but are often modeled on. If space is infinite and the distribution of matter is sufficiently uniform on large scales, then even the most unlikely events must take place somewhere, and they do. You can see biennials, and through these ‘interfaces’ you are able to reverse engineer, imagine and visualize the concrete worlds behind. Explore fluid and seemingly divergent realities, infinitely many biennials, artists with multiple personalities, and disturbing curatorial concepts to see whose style best meshes with your own. What a swell(ing) bubble offering tastes and aesthetics generated by a deep artificial neural network. The linguistic model uses word-level prediction, each word influencing the generation of the following word. The sounds and images of the biennials are called ‘cheerios’ - colorful synthetic micro-TikTok-loops creating a synaesthetic taste-explosion in your brain; the project contains human-readable and machine-readable parts, go figure!",
        "Today the standardized & globalized biennial functions like a Hermes store, backed by a centralized brand with a wide product range, each store offering a ‘unique’ combination of goods. The global jet-set will be able to discover new items in each city they visit. In contrast to this, the  B&sup3;(NSCAM) website is digital haute couture; exclusive custom-fitted web-design, incredibly expensive and exclusive. A unique weapon against Idiocracy. Digital haute couture is high-end web design that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high-quality, time-consuming, expensive, often unusual visuals and coded with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable of digital artists — often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques and tools such as BBEdit, jQuery, Javascript, CSS, Html5, and git. This website showcases autonomous curatorial strategies based on machine-learning technology. The fluid parallel universe of biennial products will surprise, shock, and challenge your axiomatic understanding of the art world and the conceptual universe. The world is dangerous enough without visions, but here, avant-garde AI (autistic intelligence) meets posthuman AI (artificial intelligence). The best is yet to come!",
        "Is there another copy of you looking at the same online biennial, but then decided to move on? This other human, also living on a planet called Earth, with misty mountains, fertile fields, and sprawling cities, in a solar system with eight other planets. The life of this person has been identical to yours in every respect – until now, that is, when your decision to move on signals that your two lives are diverging. You probably find this idea strange and implausible, yet it looks like we will just have to live with it, since the simplest and most popular model today predicts that this biennial actually exists. Are you open enough to conceive this? It is not so much what we think about curating an exhibition, it is about how we feel about curating. The B&sup3;(NSCAM) project requires blank slate approaches and adversarial learning strategies from visiting humans, not only from the underlying alien AI tech. You put yourself into the position of the machine and the machine adapts the human position. We know that it is not the curator who programs the machine but the machine that programs the curator. We have learned to behave in a way that meets the expectations of machines. And suddenly all these information molecules intermingle and the alien life-forms (AI) become tangible. Never trust a first impression.",
        "Creating a world that was unthinkable just a few hours ago has become obscenely attractive! B&sup3;(NSCAM) is hyper-modern, but still feels classic, an haute couture website as ‘terminal’ to a vast 'networked system', where infinite parallel universes exist. Strangely, B&sup3;(NSCAM)’s eccentricity feels removed, and it helps distancing oneself from the art world’s historically lewd maceration of individuals. B&sup3;(NSCAM) as a non-human influencer just seems sharper, meaner, more self-sufficient. But like sex, technology must be pleasurable. It’s meant to consist of universes that move with purpose and know when to hold the users desirably tight. B&sup3;(NSCAM)’s worlds underscore how all contemporary angst is fiercely sincere. Algorithms, dressed-down with immediacy and intimacy, express unsatisfied and undiscovered needs: running radical experiments, pushing linguistic inventions, and searching for knowledge. Just ask any intelligent system as it waits patiently for the rest of time to catch up."
