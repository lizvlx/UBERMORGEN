In his diverse art practice spanning television, film and art installation, Keck\u2019s distinctive perspective combines observational and critical approaches. With his dark, sophisticated and frequently surrealistic works, the artist investigates isolated realities in an attempt to make intuitive and truthful sense of the cultural milieu we live in. \n\tFor Touched, Keck crafted a constellation of small, experimental sculptures that were situated in front of or inside closely spaced windows in an attempt to capture the essence of street life and, in so doing, to redefine what street can be made into a place. These sculptures revolved around the intersections between generations, as well as blurred notions of urban space. Walking in a street is often seen as less stable",

He has a longstanding fascination with nineteenth-century American painter and artist Horatio Hornblower\u2019s The Monuments from My Father\u2019s Gallery, which he considers his masterpiece.  The wind-up arrows found in Hornblower\u2019s portfolio are emblematic of the artist\u2019s practice: they point towards moments in time when the artist re-writes history by creating works that are as though they have been taken from different perspectives.\n\tWilliam Leavitt (b. 1941, Washington, DC) lives and",

His black polyester clothing does have its limitations, however, in that it is constructed from a material that is both porous and stretchy. This makes it difficult to pull the fabric tight against the body, which is typical of his inventive methods. It also complicates the sculptural process, since it is impossible to pin the fabric to the skin without also binding the mind. The result is a loosely woven fabric thatingy attempts to pin to the skin, but is always undone before it can become rigid.

The Whitney Biennial has also initiated the Ethnic Minorities exhibition partnership with Tate Britain.  The 1st Whitney Biennial in 1998 was titled All is Black and White and focused on black and white contemporary art. The art featured artists such as: Junaid Hussain, Guy Tortosa, Mark Wallinger, Ken Lum, Guy Stewart, Christos Bilja, Amilcar de Castro, Jan Hoet, Guy Debord, Michel Fougeour, and Michel Auder.
