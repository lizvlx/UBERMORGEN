Through associative thought processes his artworks materialise in many different forms: from sculptures, objects, videos and installations to videos, essays, photographs, sound and performance. \n\tSimunek\u2019s Afrocentric training system utilises the legacy of the Cholula Wars (the creation of a cauldron of international attention in the early 1960s centred on Lake Superior) and the ongoing migration crisis to create a picture of contrasting values and aspirations. His training imagined a parallel, but unequal, universe. Underpinning this shifting imaginary Reality is a deep concern about ideas of cultural ownership and the power of ideas, which is at the heart of his work. \n\tThe",

Julficar is developing a kinetic narrative work that will view the city as a series of 'living rooms', each a unique room, each equipped with a different video game. The project, titled V/A\u2019IL LA CA$O (2009), is based on the Tamil term  limerick , which roughly translates to \u2018the language of writing\u2019. Julficar\u2019s work explores how language \u2013 the medium through which we create and communicate value \u2013 can be used to symbolicise not only the things we value but the assumptions we have to start with. By infusing everyday language with technological gadgetry, Julficar is aiming to create a new world of possibility for artists and designers",
        "Yazaira Kintz (b. 1940, Hassan, India) lives in London, UK. Through her avowedly feminist analysis of Indian and global culture, the artist\u0107s paintings, drawings, video and essays engage with social issues such as women\u2019s right to choose; the economic and political systems that ignore or downplay the importance of cultural diversity; and the ideologies that justify or ignore discrimination. From her dramatic using of colour in black and white on the one hand and monochrome in Photoshop on the other, the artist\u0107s forceful, if often conflicted, narratives compel us to face up to issues of gender, sexuality, authoritarianism, capital and world politics. \n\tKintz\u2019s recent commission for Liverpool Biennial 2012, titled Female Chauvinist (2012), is",

Most of Ghanshyam's work is created during visits to new contexts, which he describes as \u2018fields of confrontation\u2019. These new contexts often confront him with contested concepts, historic or contemporary, and his inquiries invariably center on the themes of what is authentic and what is not. His multifaceted inquiry often focuses on the art/political connotations of public space, especially when this public space is dominated by the accumulation of consumer data. \n\tAs part of Liverpool Biennial 2016, Razavi has created a two-channel video installation incorporating elements from film and popular culture. The work, titled \n\tWhite Christmas (2016), combines elements of documentary and popular culture to analyse and comment",

Her tagging practices have shifted from using the tag 'bad' in reference to the graffiti and graffiti-like writing found in many major urban publications (The Register, The Standard, Sunday Times) to using tags such as \u2018street life\u2019 or \u2018visual art\u2019.

The picture they took in 1996 showed five children from the Saker\u2019s congregation; on the inside, they saw a portrait of Jesus, cast as it were a portrait they had never seen or, worse still, a picture of their grandfather.

In 1996, FiercePix developed a format for photographing traffic accidents in which the deceased are deliberately left on the tracks, desecrating the sacred space of the tracks and all those who have followed them. In 2005, he explored the psychological and physical effects of a flatbed truck driver\u2019s death at work, and in 2008 presented photographs of his extended family at their home in rural Maharashtra state.

As one of the first artists to be granted Hong Kong residency, Cefaratti\u2019s work often deals with the politics of movement, fame and identity.

She follows a practice that builds, across multiple materials and techniques, a constantly shifting range of meanings.  While most films are shot in black-and-white, Roeber generates her films with coloured light. This gives her films a symbolic meaning beyond that of mere film. Light and colour transform the two-channel video produced for Channel 4D for International 04 into vibrant, multi-channel video. The artist's vibrant imagination was equally at work in the colour version, where it created a symbolic shift from monochrome to multi-channel video.Mona Haraki\u2019s work \u2013 which combines architecture, performance and installations \u2013 takes a deep-time perspective towards our present-day environmental crisis.",

Goedicke is interested in the beautiful, fragile and imaginative qualities of material and creates sculptures, installations and works based on body images. Between 1967-74, she was an artist with the largest and most prestigious art commissions of her career. Her subject matter is profoundly personal and examines the impact of trauma, incarceration and ill-treatment on the individual. Her work incorporates large-scale images, social and graphic protocols, as well as aids to the written language, shape-shifting and other forms of apparatuses of representation. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016 Goedicke has utilised the same transmission mechanism that brings life to her sculpture series \n\tIn the Public Sphere to bring life",

Displacement and disembodiment were frequent topics of conversation. A confluence of technologies and traditions, including video, interactive art and performance, now defines how we live and how we experience the world.

Unangst is attracted to sites where the underlying material of a statue or monument has been left to deteriorate in the natural environment, resulting in its eventual desecration. This has led to the formation of a multitude of unofficial or forgotten monuments, some of which are quite remarkable, such as those commemorating Jewish survivors of the Nazi Holocaust, or Buddhist icons. Others, less familiar, less jaw-dropping, simply repeatable forms of desecration. For Unangst, the process of sculpting a new monument was a means to an end: to protest against the frequent desecration of temples and landmarks by unscrupulous souvenir shops.

He has developed a wide range of semi-progressive forms that simultaneously cut across the traditional dichotomy between high-rise and minimalist designs. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016, Yazaira has developed a light-filled, organic sculptural space which receives and reflects reflected sunlight into its acrylic walls and floors.

In his recent projects he documents behaviour that is neither artistically created nor artistically executed: it's either deliberate indifference or it involves an appropriation of cultural terminology from another culture. Behaviour that resembles deliberate appropriation is bound to generate controversy, but the Hungarian artist accepts it as inevitable given the current political climate.

BemberWhat has come to be known as the globalization of industry and released vast amounts of wealth for international corporations seems to produce two entirely distinct kinds of people: those who primarily inhabit or inhabit amongst others (mass[1] that means a global community of inhabitants).[2]People who primarily inhabit another part of the world, and also inhabit other modes of cultural exchange, by and large reside primarily within or in proximity to (established or well established) communities of people identified as fellow travellers. But there are needle\u2013traets, and some kind of trail signs, that point towards places other than centrally controlled system mayia producers. There are creative trust mechanisms in place to separate these modes of cultural flow.For a society to be truly holistic it needs to celebrate all aspects of its citizensry, but on the fly could also create expertise tailored to the sovereignty and territorial grabs at this moment. Migration and displacement, along with multiple systemic forms of discrimination and antagonism, make up a vital problem that cannot be dealt with or resolved by corporations or national governments.

While some degree percent change was attributed to the stepping back of the central CMH director left increasingly defenseless against corruption among senior managers and embrace of customer devices (via 1700 tax finally heroes maxed out in advance), a much more\u00ad morally weighty root cause emerged relating not only mainstream patrons and artists to congressionally narrowly defined social pariah regimes, unequal access to opportunity and inequity resting in monitoring.

The Biennial will be based in part on the existing complex of relationships between Liverpool and elsewhere in the UK and the Biennial in the North of England.  The first Liverpool Biennial will take place from 20 March \u2013 6 June, 2020 where artists will come from across the arts to collaborate, celebrate, and reflect on contemporary art. The wide array of activities reflects the diversity of contemporary musical practice and its relation to contemporary art. Liverpool Biennial will create a platform for ongoing discussion through extensive exhibitions and programs, interactive events, publications, talks and debates. Liverpool Biennial will engage audiences beyond the music community with extensive educational programs. Liverpool Biennial has a diverse arts and educational programme that ranges from pre-concert and interactive youth activities to post-concert and interactive education programmes.

Farrow said that the show was inspired by the opening of an unfinished sixth runway at LAXAMM, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Los Angeles County Art Museum, and the museum\u2019s inability to finish it.The residency program will host a series of performances and residencies in the city in 2020. Running concurrently with the exhibition is an education program, \u201cThe Future Is Yours,\u201d which will focus on the challenges and opportunities created by technology, art, and creative destruction.\u201cI want to take an example from LAXAMM. One of the projects we are working on is a series of books that will be based around the themes of replication and assemblage,\u201d Farrow said in an interview. \u201cLAXAMM\u2019s residency program had an exhibition opening the other night and it had a full house. I wanted to take this opportunity to make a statement about the future and its possibilities.\u201dArt for Life, a project of the Los Angeles\u2013based nonprofit Art in Life, will present a series of exhibitions around the themes of art and life in 2020. The first show will feature works by the artists who are part of a group called the Soul Sisters, whose practice spans cultural and spiritual fields, such as ballet, dance, architecture, and design, and will be held at LAXAMM, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.",
        "Art Museum (MAM) from 1999 to 2014, Deborah Efstathiou has announced that she is leaving the institution in January 2020 to work in the private sector. She joins the gallery, which recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, and will focus on presenting work in the space she has occupied since it opened in 2007, during the height of the global financial crisis.When asked about the role of art institutions in society in a recent Milwaukee Art Journal interview, Efstathiou said: \u201cArt museums are the incubators of ideas and skills. The museum creates the social and cultural environment for these ideas to circulate and be expressed on more fundamental levels of life. Art is not just a prop, it is the lifeblood, the soulblood of the community.\u201d The statement concludes with a quote from Bob Dylan, who she said \u201cI have never met anyone who had as much fun as I.\u201d\n\n\nThe Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, is considering relocating the sculpture gardens of its two campuses to a climate-controlled building on Pennsylvania Avenue in the city.

In an email sent to staff on March 3, CEO Ellen Breschke wrote: \u201cWe believe that the new climate-controlled building, which will be built on the fifth floor of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, will provide a better climate-controlled experience for our guests and community.\u201dThe Hirshhorn opened to the public in 1963, two years after the completion of the ten-mile Tri",
        "Art Museum for two years, landscape and video artist Susan Bevan, whose practice spans photography, sculpture, installation, performance, and installation art, has announced that she is retiring in March 2020. After spending fifteen years at the institution, Bevan moved to New York in 2006 to teach at New York University.\u201cMy practice has been a constant evolution of photography and video\u0097both in media and in my own life,\u201d the artist said in a statement. \u201cEvolution takes many forms, and so it has been a constant task of my practice to use photography and video as a vehicle for my own vision.\u201dIn the art world, Bevan and her peers were conscious of the limits of what images could achieve. \u201cIn the 1960s, the use of photography and video was almost unprecedented,\u201d she told Artforum. By gaining access to her subjects through a series of voyeuristic photo opportunities, the photographer was able to gain a greater sense of intimacy with them.\u00a0\u201cMy work, like that of many artists, is a vehicle for their vision,\u201d Bevan said. \u201cThis is a terrible loss to the arts.\u201dThe artist also credited her colleagues who have achieved more than her, including sculptors Robert Irwin, Roderick DeNiro, and Jacques-Louis David, as contributing to her career and to the future of art. Bevan currently serves as an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota and a fellow at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.She will release a new photographic study of \u201cForbidden to See,\u201d which she made in collaboration with artist Michael Ondaatje, in January 2020.\n\n\nThe Tate\ufffd",
