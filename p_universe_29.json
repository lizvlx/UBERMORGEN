        "   Next Liverpool Biennial was founded in 1998. For the first time an international committee of professionals in the field of visual arts and culture was invited to tender the task of selecting the participating works. The works that were selected went on to become the core of the Biennial. The Biennial Bahraini Tourist is one of the most recognisable sights in the Bahraini city.  It was initiated in 1998 by the British-Bahraini art distributor Art Lotif. It has since become one of the most important art events in the country. The Biennial was launched as the Bahraini National Arts Festival by the Ministry of Culture.  In time the festival would become an autonomous institution and a separate festival from the Government Communications and Information Technology (GIT) and the Ministry of Information Technology. It would have been called Bahrain International Film Festival or simply Bahrain International. The Festival started from grassroots level gathering the support of selected art institutions and artists. Over the years, through partnerships with these institutions, the Biennial has managed to develop special events catering mainly to the Bahraini community.  The main international group exhibitions have all taken place in the past decade: 2001 Abu Dhabi Exhibition, 2003 Bangkok Biennial, 2005 Istanbul Biennial, 2007 New York City Biennial, 2009 Abu Dhabi Biennial, 2011 Istanbul Biennial, 2013 Abu Dhabi Biennial, 2016 Tokyo International Biennial, and 2017 Abu Dhabi Biennial. Source: www.bhabi.org.br  <ENDOFTEXT> Since its inception in December 1978, the Biennial has contributed to and redefined the concept of international contemporary art.   The Biennial was founded by the East Africa Art Center (AAC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,",
        "  The concept of combining contemporary art with the historical and literary legacy of Liverpool is inherently linked to the city\u2019s rich cultural heritage and the city\u2019s pioneering spirit. This is not to deny the transformative potential of art; rather, it seeks to be a discoverer, a discoverer of meaning, a discoverer of future, a discoverer of past, present and future.  In its Discourse on the City, 1991, the BAA highlighted the city\u2019s unique cultural, social and historical heritage in a discursive framework that prioritised creation of new ideas and proposals. The themes and concepts canvassed this expansive range of interests, generating discourses that prioritised creation of new arts and proposals. The Discourse on the City followed a framework originally developed for the 1988 Biennial, in which a steering committee composed of academics, artists and curators identified and developed the themes of the succeeding Biennials.  The 1991 Biennial was directed by Carolyn Law, who was appointed general secretary and guided the discursive direction of the whole event. The inaugural Biennial was titled Liverpool 1890, and it featured the work of 117 artists. Amongst artists exhibited were Bill Viola, Norman Rush, Lord Tennyson, Terrence McNally, Jean-Christoph Ammann, Christos N. Gormley, Harun Farocki, Shilpa Gupta, and many more.

The biannual international multidisciplinary event comprises visual arts, film, theater, dance, music, and performance.   Meeting Points is an international event focusing on the visual arts and other media that appear in the Arab and Muslim world. It seeks to be an open platform for both established and emerging artists, curators, and the public, while at the same time striving to present contemporary art in a high-level academic and public forum.  In an effort to make meeting points as widely available as possible, every third autumn Meeting Points takes place in the Arab World gathering artists and other practitioners in diverse locations around the globe. The Biennale promotes local artists and their productions, and the interaction of local and international artists and audiences.  The third event of the biennale series, Holy Land, explores the place of religion in the Arabic and Muslim world. It was originally organized in 2007 but has since been bi-annual.

The aim of the event was to promote contemporary art in the widest possible sphere of cultural influences and manifestations and enhance the aesthetic experience for the participants as well as the spectators. The International Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Biennial of Contemporary Art is a multidisciplinary event whose main purpose is achieved by inviting artists from a broad range of countries and regions of the world. The main international group of artists invited to participate are: Alejandro Ugarte, Carlos Castro, Fortunato Bellonzi, Sol LeWitt, Claudio Lotito, Tarek Atoui, Fortunato Bellosa, Raquel Stolf, Cin\u00e9ma Str\u00e9, Anette Kierk\u00f6sli, Johan Pousette, Mar\u00eda de Corral, Silvana Zieminski, Zsolt\u00e1n Ruggeri, and many more.

Her moving image, My Troubles started as a plea for social conscience in a city that was increasingly hostile to immigrants. The story linked two anxieties: one about racial and religious intolerance in the urban context and the other about the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Using very different mediums, the story of a woman who was raped and murdered as she tried to report an incident of sexual assault to the police moved from the pages of a local newspaper to the screen of the new Global 2002 film.

We hope that it will be a decision that will benefit and encourage everyone who has been involved in the exhibition as a whole.\u201dThe National Galleries of Scotland was given six weeks to appeal the decision by the Supreme Court of Scotland. Following a hearing on December 3rd, a three-judge panel of the court ruled that the exhibition breached its statutory obligation to \u201ccalm the spirit by allowing \u2018Green Spaces\u201d to remain on display. The court also found that the exhibition breached the European Convention on Human Rights, Scotland\u2019s Human Rights Act 1971, and the European Communities Act 1972.\u201cWe are absolutely committed to presenting exhibitions that reflect the spirit of Scotland and the National Galleries of Scotland as a whole,\u201d John O\u2019Shaughnessy, chairman of the National Galleries of Scotland, told the Art Newspaper. \u201cThe exhibition was not created in a vacuum but a part of a much larger vision of how we engage with the world. This vision has become increasingly important in the current political climate and we are now seeing the exhibition reflected in the exhibition design and in the exhibition of new works by emerging and",

Curated by artist-in-residence Max von Sydow, the exhibitions mark the museum\u2019s commitment to supporting artists through the course of their careers.The event will also introduce the public to the work of fifteen new artists, including\u00a0Ben Klock,\u00a0Tadyszko Niedzko,\u00a0Sibalas Naib,\u00a0Tzvetan Tazhayakov,\u00a0Catherine Wood,\u00a0Cindy Sherman, and\u00a0Walter Turner.

She began her career as an abstract painter in the 1980s before moving to the arts as an assistant to the Danish artist Sveinunga Eldering (1993\u201396). She returned to school in 1997, where she studied with artist-in-residence Rick Owens. In 2000, Talbot won the Guggenheim\u2019s Short-Form Illustration Prize, and in 2004, she was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2014, she received the Royal Academy of Arts\u2019 Award for Exhibition Art.\u201cJordana\u2019s work is at once profoundly feminist and profoundly prophetic,\u201d wrote Hanna Roscoe in an article in the October 2015 issue of Artforum. \u201cHer work embodies a form of artistic experimentation and a commitment to the very notion of historical temporality, a willingness to abandon the status quo and grapple with the possibilities of the future.\u201dBorn in Los Angeles in 1966 and raised in the Pacific Palisades, Talbot moved to New York in the \ufffd"
