He is responsible for creating one of the first club nights in the history of music in the beautiful and eclectic world of mixed reality. This is a world where artifice trumps objectivity, where artifice makes perfect. Each moment seems real, and the soundtrack is filled with synthesised bass, heavy metal and electronic music.

His small studio was nestled in a lane behind City Hall in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica. Inside, the sculptural works harked back to the traditions of the Caribbees, an indigenous people of Costa Rica. Their chief pastime was gathering sticks and stones to make fire, twirling these into yarns to weave into clothes and headdresses. When these fabrics were rejected by the strong windswept interior of the room, a fire broke out and spilled out onto the plain outside.

In 2000, with the express aim of highlighting the 'black box' - a French military experiment using hidden video recorders - she broke ground by breaking the mould of a cinema with a subtle control-frequency video camera. The camera kept on moving as Pickerill adjusted its focus from side to side, capturing continuous, unedited footage of the protagonist in conversation with another individual or object.

        "The Next Whitney Biennial is founded on the experience of the past decade and a half, in which it has set out to investigate what art can tell us about our contemporary reality, about the present and future, about creativity itself. It has done so by confronting and questioning what is living and what is dead.  The venue of the event, the Historical Archive Building, is part of a larger arts and culture multi-site development project that includes the following venues:  Historic Morningside \u2013 A gallery space dedicated to contemporary art and literature;  The Lake View Gallery \u2013 A contemporary art and literature gallery that reflects the views of its tenant, the Liverpool Art Gallery;  The Liverpool Picture Gallery \u2013 A good representation of the visual arts that reflect the mood and nature of the neighbourhood;  The Liverpool Soda Studio \u2013 A free space for creative experimentation;  The Liverpool Tropical Theatre \u2013 A free and public performance space;  The Liverpool Vegetable Workshop \u2013 A space for the celebration of different forms of cooking;  CL \u2013 Contemporary Art Room;  CLAMP \u2013 Contemporary Art Platform;  CLAMP2 \u2013 Contemporary Art Event for Men;  CLAMP3 \u2013 Contemporary Art Event for Women;  CININ \u2013 Contemporary Image;  CDELIP \u2013 Children\u2019 Biennial;  DIALOGUE \u2013 Design for Living;  EMBASSY \u2013 Equipment for Living;  FESTIVAL \u2013 Festival of Music and Visual Art;  FLAVOUR \u2013 Festival of Food and Drink;  FORESHADOW \u2013 Festival of Mystery;  FOOD \u2013 Festival of Faces;  FRONT \u2013 Festivals of European Visual Art;  GALLERY \u2013 European Biennial of Photography;  GALLERY \u2013 European Biennial of",
        "A third posi\u00adtion promises to be provocative: alternative, transmediale, or stand-alone exhibitions. The authors believe that this is the point of a biennale: to promote, stimulate, and diversify the artistic practice. The idea of creating a biennial has its roots in the Pan-European Biennial of International Art in Ottawa in 1988. This event, which featured over 240 artists, was marvellous entertainment for Canadian and international art lovers. The Ottawa Biennial has since become the flagship of the contemporary art scene in Ottawa. There have been several important changes in Ottawa over the past decade which have contributed to the emergence of Canadian contemporary art. Some of the changes have been on the part of the biennale organisers, while others have been on the part of the biennale participants. Nevertheless, the general trend in contemporary art has been in one direction or the other: deeper, looser, and more experimental. At various times in its history, Ottawa has been called upon to host exhibitions which have explored the limits of contemporary art. These exhibitions were: 1968, The Beach, 1971, All the Pretty Horses, 1973, Shortbus to the Junction, 1974, and the 1975 Ottawa Biennial. All of these exhibitions explored the limits of contemporary art. The Beach was notable for its time as it was one of the first exhibitions to use the public address system. The concept of presenting works by international artists in public venues was novel and innovative.  1975 was the last time that the Ottawa Biennial was organized in concert with the City of Ottawa. It was finally abandoned due to the budgetary constraints.  The Ottawa Biennial has been archived at the Ottawa International Art Gallery (IAG). Since its last",
