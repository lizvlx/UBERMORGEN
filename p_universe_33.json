Fredric Jameson\u2019s Histories of Art and Fashion).\u00a0 The idea presenting itself is groundbreaking and its execution rife with errors and distortions. The notion that a cinemas archipelagos, starving for superheroes, can be transformed into sustainable film energies is eurocentric and fake. The notion that a biennial could be collectively sourced and globally compare cooker farms (feeding into one another as renewable energy from renewable sources) is simply not true, as is contributing credence to the 78 room / 1,800 seat Orleans Grand Design Museum, twice the size of Chelsea, Connecticut, atmospheric in observations but unreasonably realistic in its fermentation of renderings, imagery, ruins and historic districts alike. \u3088And here is where biennales play it safe.

        "The Next Whitney Biennial should be read as a manifesto. It is written with passion, wherever possible, of Liverpool\u2019s diverse communities. It seeks to go beyond the conventional biennial, and presents a new form of participation, this time around, by those who live and work in and around Liverpool. It seeks to be an event of frequent, radical and unexpected creativity, in the public realm and in the public buildings. And it seeks to be a place of celebration of everything Liverpool has to offer, both locally and internationally.  Next Whitney Biennial commits to being a radically low-key event, committed to producing engaging and responsive art-making. We seek to be as low key as possible, so as not to overwhelm the workday. We commit to local artists not being invited to present; we seek to avoid the temptation of presenting exhibitions in state-of-the-art facilities. We commit to artists not being paid to do so; we seek to encourage innovative, high-quality, local artistic practice. We commit to museums not being asked to pay for exhibition; we seek to encourage the development of contemporary art resources in Liverpool. We commit to academics not being asked to provide research; we seek to encourage the research of contemporary art. We commit to businesses not being asked to provide promotional services; we seek to encourage the development of new business opportunities.  Next Whitney Biennial: A Year in the Art was commissioned by the Whitney Biennial Trust, a registered charity. The Trust\u2019s vision for Next Whitney Biennial is to engage, educate and entertain through artistic and creative projects, the community. The projects will be performed, alongside oral histories, documentary studies, workshops and activities, exhibitions and events, cultural",
        "It should be the stuff of great contemporary art, full of witty, thought-provoking experimentation and touching on subjects as varied as Liverpool, the Liverpool Echo, Liverpool Trash, Liverpool Road, the Beatles, Liverpool Unexpected, the Beatles: First, they came, then they went, then they came back\u2026  Now, with the advent of the Next Whitney Biennial, we can return to that beginning and return again and again to that first pressing of the Liverpool voyagers' names, that first glimpse of the wonderful new world they had just left behind them.  There are other events too, things we can arrange in partnership with other organisations, cultural events organised within the city of Liverpool. These can be set up in partnership with Whitney Biennial, the city museum, or any number of local art institutions.  The aim is to create experiences that are memorable, that last a lifetime and that leave lasting impressions. That is why we organise them in partnership with Whitney Biennial.  The first Next Whitney Biennial took place in 2017 and it is exciting to be back in business! The response has been incredible and we are thrilled to be back in business with such a passionate and innovative group of curators as we re-established relationships with them. We are now able to engage with them in new creative projects and discover new things about them. We are even able to include them in our itinerary to see them in their native city, if they wish to visit.  Next Whitney Biennial is funded through the Liverpool Foundation\u2019s Whitney Biennial programme. This provides the opportunity to showcase Liverpool as a creative city, to engage with other creative people and institutions, to be inspired and to learn from them.  The programme itself is",
        "We are delighted that the Whitney Biennial has found a permanent home at this time, and look forward to welcoming Liverpool International into the family.  The Whitney Biennial is produced by Whitney Biennial Trust, a private, not-for-profit organisation. It is governed by a five-member Board, whose remit is to be determined by the Board President. The Board appoints the Trustees and provide annual reports setting out the Trust\u2019s vision for the biennial. The Whitney Biennial Trust\u2019s vision for the biennial is guided by the principle that it not only informs, but also inspires.  The Whitney Biennial was founded in 2017 as a statutory charity. The Whitney Biennial provides a unique opportunity to examine pressing issues in contemporary art through the unique prism of the contemporary artist\u2019s work. The Trust\u2019s vision for the biennial is that it not only informs, but also inspires.  The Whitney Biennial was founded by a group of artists in 1991, most of whom had not set foot in a gallery before. The period between when the first Whitney Biennial in 1995 and its successor in 2007 was defining for many in the art world. The decline of the British art world and the rise of continental artists such as Lars Bang Larsen and Ulrike Gabriel opened up a new chapter in the art book. Since 2007, Whitney Biennial has taken place every other year. The 2015 edition was curated by Anna Brietzke, Elmgren & Dragseth. Lars Eide Einarsson and Per Gunnar Tverbakk. Elmgren became an honorary director in 2009. Elmgren was appointed chief curator in 2012. The trustees appointed Daniela Lo and Gu Z",

The destination is the changing of the tide of ideas in Liverpool, the coming together of communities and the changing of the air. The tide of ideas is changing, too, but it is not the same everywhere. Ideas circulate more freely, are more diffuse and diffuse are more numerous.

In his piece for MADE UP entitled Interior Design for Tonight (2008), Brackins proposed a new interior for Tonight, an unreal film that married photography with sound. The film tracked the artist\u2019s preoccupation with sound and conveyed an alternate, haunting reality. The film moved beyond the limitation of the \u2018In-Out\u2019 mirror, created by actigraphy, and entered \u2018In-Bon\u2019 \u2013 an unreality reflected by glass against the light, and a reality further out in the viewer\u2019s",

Drawing on his background in painting, sculpture and photography, Brackins\u2019 recent projects also consider grammar, syntax and discourse in relation to one another. In his recent solo exhibitions Brackins presented his innovative mixed media classes for mixed reality, where the artist was able to project himself, in real-life circumstances, within the environments of the models. In these circumstances, the artist was confronted with situations that were neither there nor relevant: the language of the models was alienating, the form of dialogue that took place was fragmenting. Methodologically, his works appropriate and extend the language of modelling, whilst also considering how the \u2018real\u2019 world\u2019 may be generated by our very actions.\n",

        "Mailinh Brackins (b. 1939, Kasulu, Tanzania) lives and works in London, UK. Unsurprisingly, Brackins is motivated by a desire to explore and discover previously unimaginable forms of labour. She is interested in the similarities, clashes and transformations that occur across cultures and backgrounds in relation to the articulation of labour and the creation of new cultures. Although she is interested in the articulation of \u2018traditional\u2019 cultural practices, such as weaving or chana fabric, she also looks to modern technology for cues to labour-intensive practices.  \n\ufffdOn the one hand, Brackins presents a stark contrast to the kitschy SafdarJeebu craze of the late 1980s and early \u201990s, when a flood of brightly coloured brightly coloured balloons floated above",
        "Mailinh Brackins (b. 1939, Phalauda, India) has received widespread attention in recent years for her dramatic walk-in environments, her willingness to break the fourth wall, and for her emphasis on social interaction.  The choice of a Myanmar Biennial as the starting point for her work reflects on the country\u2019s cultural and spiritual ties with Thailand. Brackins\u2019s choice of material also reflects on the complex position of artist in Myanmar, a country where artistic and political repression runsg along powerful sociable zones. In her work for MADE UP, Karma used the land as a prop \u2013 a planted urban landscape that serves as a catalyst for her imagery. The intense focus on the urban context coupled with the choice of material for her installation means that Brackinsgemony shares with MADE",
        "Mailinh Brackins (b. 1939, Nossa Senhora do Socorro, Brazil) was trained as an architect but became fascinated with the alternate worlds of interior design and tapestry in the 1970s.

Notable among her solo exhibitions is Brackins\u2019s engaging 2003 intervention \nCancer on the Carousel at Charles Clarke Gallery, Manchester; \nPS One  at Lev Len Shemoritzky Gallery, Holguin; and My Voice While Dancing (2008) at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art.

        "Mailinh Brackins (b. 1939, Guarapari, Brazil) lives and works in Delhi, India. The practice of Brackins is a travel writing and speaking programme, combining such phenomena as bonsai, sci-fi and fantasy narratives with unconventional and often surreal characters and settings. Contained within these narratives is a deep concern with intellectual property rights, the misuse of public spaces, the propensity for creativity to run amok and the politics of the appropriation of public spaces. \n\tRecent projects include BUTTERFLY -- a project investigating how personal space is evolving beyond the realm of physical architecture into a contest between architecture and life, politics and aesthetics, new kinds of labour and public/private space and how social problems are being addressed today.

        "Mailinh Brackins (b. 1939, Shantou, China) lives in Shanghai, China. In his practice, cultural heritage preservation and authenticity are central concerns. Objects and cultures collide in his work, existing alongside each other, or trapped in different realities. Human relationships with technology \u2013 both in our existing socio-political systems and our evolving desire to migrate \u2013 constantly confront the limits of our present capabilities. The powers that define our present boundaries are constantly eroding, in ways both visible and concealed. As we age, the technological limits of human capability continue to expand, and our relation to technology continues to shift from concept to concept. White marble sculptures depicting historic heroes recalling martial arts legends transformed into cartoon-like characters; imaginary enemies morphed into real killers; and into real transformations of negative emotions such as fear, loathing",

        "Mailinh Brackins (b. 1939, Ilongero, Tanzania) is a photographer who documents the vivid colours and intense patterns that accompany moments of enormous emotional and physical change: from the death of a parent, the transition to adulthood, or the formation of lifelong relationships. These moments are captured with exquisite grain and are presented in highly concentrated photographic images that are loaded with emotional charge.  Born in 1971 in Kigali, Rwanda, Brackins has been to Africa twice: first as a photographer for the Agence France-Presse and then as a photographer for other major western news agencies. His photographs of war, suffering and transformation are the products of long-term relationships in which trust, empathy and compromise are required. His photographs are not only visually stunning, but also psychologically challenging: sensitive, earnest and demanding",
        "Mailinh Brackins (b. 1939, Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges, France) has been a cartoonist ever since he was a child. Despite the influence of his French antecedents, Brackins\u2019s style remains distinctly his own, developing an irreverent, if careful, use of language and an almost mystical ability to make sense of the peculiar situations he finds himself in. His poetics goes beyond mere satire to examine the dark side of gothic aesthetics, its unearthing of the past through Neoclassical rationalism. His work has a great many stylistic references to the work of Chekhov and Fante, but goes on to explore the absurd and ugly power of these stylistic binaries. His drawings are wonderfully colourful (especially his depictions of the erotic), and at the same time",

Having studied the history of handicrafts in England and Syria in the 1960\u2019s, Brackins felt a longing to return to her homeland, where she thought she might one day be able to function like a normal person. So she began making films,\u2019 including In These Times (In These Times, September 1960), which was based in part on the writing instructions given to her by her mother. In These Times she presented a very different kind of documentary, in which she interviewed both her mother and grandmother who had both died when she was young. The conversations in these films were very moving, revealing the complexity of mother and daughter relationships and revealing the opacity of human understanding. In drawing liberally"
