The Next Liverpool Biennial has an irrefutable focus on the city of Liverpool, and its citizens. Detailed research and involving local people, artists and curators, the biennial has an urgent and direct shot at addressing the city\u2019s current and future challenges.  The Next Liverpool Biennial taps into the energy and creativity of the city and its citizens, alongside artists and curators from across the world.

On Thursday, June 28, the Department of Arts and Culture (DAC) announced that it would cease funding the Venice Biennale, which was set to run from May to November of this year. The announcement followed a three-month review, which found that the event was not sufficiently protected by the federal government.According to the Washington Post, the museum gave the Interior Department until June 27 to review a proposal for a $120 million appropriation for the construction of a new pavilion for the Venice Biennale. The request for the $120 million appropriation was made in January, three months after the pavilion was supposed to open.
