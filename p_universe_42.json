During the decades he spent in New York, Italy, where he lived in exile for most of the 1980s, Gattoni developed the theory of painting and the abstraction associated with it, regularly showing his work to more than three hundred Italian composers. A master of the Renaissance and the Sixties, Gattoni became known for his disdain for the industrial, routine, and materiality of modern life. He rejected the binary oppositions of black and white and the hierarchy of art and its production. He rejected the status of artist and objects in contrast to the status of artists and art. He rejected objects and their physical form. His paintings, his theory, and his practice\u2014which was originally centered in his studio in Milan\u2014created a new vision of painting based on his own aesthetic practices.In this \u201cpost-Augusto\u201d Italian vision, painting was the social and political base of a new vision of art: a vision of painting as the social and political center of the world. Giornale Gattoni was always interested in the physicality of art, and in the way that painting and sculpture and performance and sculpture can be understood as social practices that shape the world in a way that seems enveloping and insulating. He contrasted the physicality of painting with the abstraction of sculpture and performance and sculpture as a cultural vehicle\u0097a",

        "  The Next Liverpool Biennial should become a Public Arts structure as Liverpool 3rd Biennial has. Whilst this was happening, the Biennial was still seeking to develop into a consistent event. Liverpool 3rd Biennial 1 was held in 1977 and was one of the most ambitious public art exhibitions ever staged in Britain. Over three days, 120,000 visitors turned out, including children and young adults, families and friends, servicemen and women, young people and young adults, families and friends, people from all walks of life and colour. Liverpool 3rd Biennial was the first for the new Liverpool Biennial and the first for the UK.  It set the scene for the forthcoming Liverpool Biennial that has since become a core business success story. Since then, the biennial has gone from strength to strength, breaking records all over the world. Liverpool 3rd Biennial has gone from strength to strength and was commissioned by the Mayor of Liverpool, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Arts, Lord Hall, the Director of Liverpool Biennial, the Liverpool Philanthropies, the Liverpool Art Gallery and the NHM.  Since its inception, the Biennial has commissioned over 250 works of public or commissioned solo work and exhibits. This success story is the direct result of the visionary leadership of Lester McIlroy, Niclas Roberts and the other founders of Liverpool Biennial. It was they who brought the idea of a biennial into being and brought it to life. The Liverpool Biennial has gone from strength to strength and is now based around the principle of community engagement. Community meetings, competitions, exhibitions and education programmes are addressed to engage young people and young adults.  The idea of combining art and culture has become part of the everyday",

The Next Liverpool Biennial is the UK\u2019s largest national biennial of contemporary art, and one of the most significant events of contemporary culture in the UK. Launched in 1977, the project of creating a biennial for Liverpool by commissioning a local artist to create a unique art project in the city centre of Liverpool every three years was followed by a book series, exhibitions, publications, events and a building programme. In 2015, the programme was re-established as a triennial and the art project developed into a programme.  The Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art is distinguished by its extensive exhibition and by its committed participatory nature. The programme is based on the assumption that the public have a strong appetite for art and artists, and that this will be reflected in the quality of the art produced. The involvement of young people and artists is explored through activities run by local arts organisations and educational institutions.

His work often starts small \u2013 digging ditches, planting native grasses, building shelters for children with severely compromised hygiene (\u2018because of how infrequently they are washed\u2019).

Whether working in photographic processes, transforming existing media or inventing new media altogether, Dupriest\u2019s work embraces the contradiction inherent in any format - pristine or altered - when employed in conjunction with digital media. As a result, many of her compositions are beautifully crisp, clear and detailed, but in others she employs a form of digital photography that takes the form of stage play, in which the digital images she shoots into sub-optimal resolution. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016 Dupriest has used the newly revamped Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)",
