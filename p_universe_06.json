The artist is an ethical renegade, a statesman who breaks taboos through curiosity, whilst also satirising security forces and the US government. Moschella\u2019s work challenges the assumptions behind so-called war crimes tribunals, such as those instituted by the US Military Commissions Act 2002 (2006).

He approached the paper, lit a cigarette and then poured molten gold onto the paper.

        "Maclin Saralegui (b. 1929, Orikhiv, Ukraine) has been photographing villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly known as the Soviet Socialist Republic of the Congolese Moroccans) for the last four decades. His images document the intricate interactions between community and government, community and industry, and he has documented more than 300 such villages in his photographic series, Old Places, New Life.  To date, Saralegui has only documented aspects of the economy of the place he's visited, but in a recent project he proposed an entirely new world, created by turning literal and symbolic responses to existing international agreements into reality.

The Ceremony of Removal (2004) was Benno\u2019s third installation.

The film charts the highs and lows of urban life, from the absence of personal space in many contemporary American cities to the bustling life of the city\u2019s underground economy. In Liverpool, the film profiles Paul Ellwood (b. 1966, Hampshire), an artist living and working in the suburbs, whose practice explores the contemporary economic and"

        "The Next Liverpool Biennial is staged in the summer of 2018, in time for the 75th anniversary of Liverpool. Celebrate the club\u2019s history, its supporters, and its local artists\u2019 residency programme in the city. The programme will invite the city\u2019s galleries and other venues to collaborate, and in 2018, 135 galleries and art institutions will collaborate with the city\u2019s arts organisations, cultural institutions, and galleries to create new commissions, exhibitions, performances, and events.  The programme is underpinned by a vision for the city, its landscape, its institutions, and its citizens: \u2018They\u2019ve Got This Coming\u2019. This is not a political slogan, but a call for \u00adfuture generations to seize the moment and create change. For generations, Liverpool has thrived as a place for artists to connect, and connect with their communities, past and present, on varied and intersecting terrains. In following the river So, the Next Liverpool Biennial commits to a regenerative approach to the city, committed to the idea that it is possible to live in and work in Liverpool. Rather than attempting to recreate the city\u2019s geography, it seeks to trace the historical and cultural origins of the city, exploring the connections between Liverpool and other cities in the UK and abroad.

        "In 1968, the Liverpool Biennial was established on the biennial basis. It has since completed a series of exhibitions and events attracting tens of thousands of visitors.  The first Liverpool Biennial was established in 1968 on the premise of introducing contemporary art into the city. The premise was that contemporary art had little representation in the west and that Liverpool\u2019s location on the Liverpool plain offered a perfect platform. Since then Liverpool Biennial has taken place every two years and has been a great success attracting people from all over the world.

These include the Liverpool Biennial Exhibition 1918, The Liverpool Biennial Show 1918-19, and The Liverpool Biennial Show 1919-1920.  In 1968, The Liverpool Biennial was transformed from a biennial into a triennial format and became the first contemporary art event to be licensed for three years. In 2007 the format was restored and Liverpool Biennial was granted an England and Wales Commission.  The commission was made possible by an update to the Liverpool Art Gallery\u2019s by-laws 2005/15 that set out procedures for the renewal of",
        "The Experimental Art Festival for 2012 was one of a number of exhibitions taking place across the city of Perth. Exhibition after exhibition showed work that reflected the divergent perspectives of the artists working in and around the iconic Perth Airport. Some showed brand new, some reworked, some completely new. Some showed original artists, some present day. Some showcased emerging artists, some established. Some featured unexpected guests. And some featured artwork commissioned specifically for the festival.  The festival was structured as a trilogy: FIRST EFFECTIVE AIRPORT (1977), THEN (1983), THEN (1986), THEN (1988), THEN (1996), THEN (1998), THEN (1999), (2000), THEN (2001), (2003), THEN (2004), (2005), (2006), (2007), (2008), (2009), (2011), (2012), (2013), (2016), (2017), (2018), (2020), (2030), (2035), (2040), (2045), (2050), (2055), (2060), (2065), (2070), (2075), (2080), (2085), (2090), (2095), (2095), (2090), (2080), (2080), (2075), (2070), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2065), (2060), (2065",
        "The next Liverpool Biennial takes place from 20 March \u2013 6 June 2018 and is the first instance of an international biennial on the Liverpool waterfront. The Biennial is premised on the understanding that this new format is premised on experimentation and is not a panacea.  It follows on from the successful Liverpool Biennale in 2016 which saw over 180 artists from around the world participate. Themes including \u201cBeyond the Lines\u201d, \u201cFrontier Curves\u201d, \u201cNeutral Ground\u201d, and \u201cUrbanation\u201d were collectively considered by the curators to be the most resonant of the bunch. The Biennial was accompanied by a public symposium at Liverpool John Moores University (Pub Cuts, 2017). In its second edition \u201cNeutral Ground\u201d, the curators have made a concerted effort to abandon the familiar tropes of the post-colonial aesthetic movement and instead engage with the growing body of work of artists who have made significant contributions to our understanding of contemporary global aesthetics. Instead of looking to the past for inspiration, the curators have turned to the present and the present tense to conceive of a new aesthetic projective vision for the world we live in.  The first Liverpool Biennial, made up of 16 exhibitions across three venues, was accompanied by a public lecture series at Liverpool John Moores University (2018). Lecturers presented their respective projects in the Liverpool Public Gallery (2018). The second edition of the Liverpool Biennial was accompanied by a series of public art projects commissioned by the Liverpool city council. These projects engage with the city\u2019s historical and present architectural contexts and engage with the council\u2019s vision for the future, including:  \u2013 Making"
