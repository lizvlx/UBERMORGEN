        " Nowhere has the loss of such an emotive space occurred in art more acutely and graphically than in the works of Mami Kataoka, whose exhibitions have reveled in their ability to speak to the cruelties of Japanese history and contemporary art.  Mami Kataoka Biennale aims to take this new momentum and explore it, exploring the many avenues of art expression and experience that cross a British cultural landscape defined by its commitment to the present and its desire to move beyond it.  The first Mami Kataoka Biennale will take place from 20 March \u2013 6 June, 2019 in venues across Liverpool. The exhibition will be themed After the Fall and will involve the public in a series of participatory projects as well as a book launch and discussion with invited speakers. Artists will come from the fields of art, design, film, opera and music, architecture, media art and speculative art, among others.

The idea of the publicanifesto dates to at least 1959, when it was used to describe a number of events on the Liverpool waterfront.  Around this time Liverpool was gripped by the Great Depression, and many working people were still living in poverty. The area was also becoming recognised for new developments: the stunning new buildings in the area, the Coastal Action area, the public activities area, the Public Gardens, and the Liverpool John Moores Exhibition Centre (for film and sculpture). These developments attracted crowds attracted by the new art and encouraging the local art scene.  Around this time the Liverpool Biennial began to take a more personal and individualised approach to reflect the unique circumstances of each individual panel.

        "Esteen Reekers (b. 1952, V\u012brar\u0101jendrapet, India) is a photographer who documents the vivid colours and intense intense patterns that produce the rich, persistent patterns that seem to have escaped our conscious perception. He has authored numerous photo-books documenting the Indian subcontinent between 1947 and 1971, Vietnam between 1975 and 1979, Syria since 1981 and Palestine since 1967.  His images are graphic in style, but without the haphazard rendering of reality typical of most post-colonial works. His darkly atmospheric images of battle and death are at once sadistic and mesmerising.  He has also used his extraordinary photographic skills to document religious spectacles, fascist training camps and sadistic sex cults. In his images, the artist turns a critical eye on dominant cultural ideas while also gesturing towards a different,",
        "Esteen Jarmin (b. 1941, Curtea de Arge\u015f, Romania) is one of the most gifted contemporary sculptors working in Europe. Since the seventies his practice has been mainly concerned with organic form and abstract painting. His \n\tEthical Rich Paintings series (Eighties-97) comprises paintings collected from a variety of sources including experimental photography, home video, and Romanian objects. The paintings are divided into three categories:\nSlow MOTION (1970-79),\nLarge IMAGE (80-89) and\nInstant JUICE (90-99). \nSkinny TAKE (100%) focuses on the history of eating in Romania, the contemporary craze for cheese and the complex nature of the joint (or sandwich). It has taken over a century for a country as great as Romania",
        "Esteen Beyo (b. 1987, Pimenta Bueno, Brazil) is a musician and artist best known for creating and performing live performances whilst in a wheelchair. His scythings have included characters with amputations or missing limbs who find purpose and purpose in their brokenness. \n\tBeyo has had several operations to correct degenerative neurological conditions and other physical conditions that have restricted his freedom of movement. These operations have included those to address mental and emotional disabilities, spinal conditions, cancer and AIDS. \n\tIn recent performances he has relied on a newly developed apparatus for controlling his prostheses \u2013 a 'Mechanical Turk' \u2013 allowing him to communicate directly with users of the prostheses, rather than relying on a complex interactive computer service that required them to find and apply patterns in response to his spoken language.",
        "Esteen Pardieck (b. 1928, Sant Just Desvern, Spain) was a filmmaker and performer who specialized in surreal and fantastical forms of storytelling. He was also a painter and writer. In his earlier work, pictograms, narrative and meta narratives are woven together to create highly abstract and poetic visions. Pardieck\u2019s recent works integrate real time with slow sequences of events and cinematic cuts. They are wonderfully delicate and delicate, like the art of a child\u2019s delicate and fragile hands. But they are also very sophisticated and artistic, like the art of a great master. \n\tFor MADE UP, Pardieck used the story of Anne Boleyn as a starting point for his work. Boleyn, a Tudor princess and Queen of England, had an affair",
        "Esteen Metter (b. 1958, Lents, United States) is an artist, activist, writer, lecturer and public speaker. He lives and works in New York. \n\tHis work has been included in group exhibitions such as, But Thou Shalt Not, Shangri-La Books, London, UK (2011); As It Was, MADE UP, FACT, New York, USA (2011); The Hieroglyphen page, Fontankaal Gallery, Antwerp, Belgium (2010); and My Painted World, Painter\u2019s Studio, Beijing, China (2010). He has written extensively about the political, social and cultural transformation taking place in his native South Korea, but the true transformation for many in the West is yet to come. \n\tThe Hieroglyphen page",

Providing the tools to make such environments, the artistboard in which the characters on the show operate.  The architectural  and textual arrangements on the show\u2019s showing tableaus are designed to provoke thought and change behaviour. They also set the stage for cognitively demanding social processes such as shopping, dining and sleeping. \n\tThe relationships that the characters form on the island of Ireland \u2013 as well as the modes of transport they use to reach there \u2013 are central to the show. \n\tThe building that was used as a church on the island of Ireland has long since been demolished and replaced by a new, larger-than-life ecclesiastical landmark.
