        "Reinhardine Stemmerman (b. 1973, Gamb\u0113la, Ethiopia) lives in Ethiopia and Australia. Her practice relates to the question of how memory operates in the human body. Through research in memory science, prosthetics and the performance arts, she both physically manifests and expresses the concepts of \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018objective truth\u2019. \n\tReinhard Mueller\u2019s (b. 1966, Kiel, Germany) ideas continue to amaze and change our perception of the world. It is said that the image of the artist that was most deeply implanted in Liverpool\u2019s collective memory was that of a school bus full of pupils from Liverpool\u2019s Annie\u2019s school bus company, International 04. These pupils\u2019 recollections were mixed together and finally published as a",
        "Reinhardine Bubak (b. 1941, Okhtyrka, Ukraine) is a photographer who documents the vivid colours and intense hues of contemporary life, in positive and negative ways. Positive: by capturing moments of delight, passion, joy and often quite beautiful, horrific or even ecstatically colourful encounters. Negative: by taking realistic photographs which, despite their strong emotional force, are carefully composed and photographed to remove the human element from the equation. Their work reveals the consistent use of a variety of media \u2013 including but not limited to film, photographs, stills, posters, still images and still lifes \u2013 to convey very different aspects of human experience from year to year. Reinhard Bubak\u2019s series of photographs titled No Reservations (1991-2001) show the profound yearning felt by many people in Britain",
        "Reinhardine Bobet (b. 1988, Ila Orangun, Nigeria) suggests that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. She is fascinated by the beauty rituals that accompany some Muslim rituals, and by the \u2018secular beauty standards\u2019 usually applied to these practices. By way of commentary on these ideas, she transmits Marilyn\u2019s famous three-word message:\n\u2018Be careful what you wish for,\u2019 she says, \u2018or else you will regret it.\u2019 To paraphrase a famous Zen saying, she reminds us of our desire not to wish or to expect anything in return; we wish to be approached and received with an attitude of openness, including the intentional and unintentional use of our beauty-seeking faculties.How to Dress for Successful Storytelling: A Pract",
        "Reinhardine Laswell (b. 1929, Miyakonoj\u014d, Japan) has done wonders with her Imaginary Number System, a system that takes the number 0 and creates an imaginary unit for each number, as well as a system to represent 1 through 9. Her ability to think in both abstract and concrete ways has been marred in recent years by mental illness, but her unwavering optimism never falters. Laswell is lucky to be alive and kicking, as she seems to be on the verge of complete creative self-reflection.  She is much loved by her colleagues at Aoshima\u2019s Modern Reader, and receives an Ichibei award for services to writing. While the formal award structure of the Modern Reader is perhaps Aoshima\u2019s most famous work, her post-Modernist Modern",

Since the late 1980s she has been a psychoanalyst working with patients who have suffered break-downs and psychosomatic illnesses, and whose stories have left patients with profound questions about the meaning and function of the self. \n\tPsychoanalyst and writer Ferdinando Jancar\u2019s new book for Liverpool Biennial 2016, \n\ufffdThe First Hour (2016), recounts the fictional story of Drishtipat and addresses the subject of the human body.Drishtipat was a resident of Malaysia who was trained as an ophthalmologist but switched fields in order to treat sightseeing clients.

She combines these two principal means of expression in The Lost Highway (2008) a six-screen multi-media video installation, often working with text. \n\tFor Liverpool Biennial 2016 Reinhard Saldedo has been commissioned to work together with Mark Lewis (b.1967, Zurich, Switzerland) and Stephen Hunt (b.1972, Bremen, Germany), on the newly commissioned project The Central Park Cycle (2014).

        "The International Association of the Festival of Sarafan was formed in 1960 through the initiative of the Foundation, which acts as the main custodian of the foto collection. The Foundation is a private, not-for-profit institution whose principal function is the upkeep of the collection and the training of the artists. Its affiliated organisations are the Iran Contemporary Art Foundation, the Freedom House Foundation, the International Crisis Group, the Public Art Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art.  Since its inception, the Festival of Sarafan has regularly featured \u2018Sarafan Triennial\u2019 , where outstanding international artists are invited to present their works at venues in London. The expanded edition in 1971, the same year of the Shah Reza Pahlavi birthday, was titled Suraksha Triennial and the following year\u2019s editions were expanded to a three-month period spanning August to November. In 1974, the period of Iranian Islamic Renaissance was expanded to thirty years.  In 1985, the name of the Festival of Sarafan was changed to Festival of Contemporary Art and the Festival was established as a statutory cultural institution. The name was changed again to Festival of Contemporary Music in 1994.  In 1997, the Festival was established as a statutory cultural institution and its name changed to Festival of Contemporary Art and Culture. It was at this point that the Festival began to extend into the East End, into the Local, into the Borough of Sarpol-Anz and into the Erdington area. In 2005, the Festival was established in partnership with the Whitney Museum and the Seattle Art Museum, and further partnered with the Fletcher Institute.

        "The International Biennial of Contemporary Art, established in 1977, is the largest biennial on a continental basis with a 150,000 sq m art exhibition and 250,000 sq m art program in London. The program includes exhibitions, staged in diverse locations throughout London, during the summer months. The central exhibition space is known as the 'Rupert Gardner Lecture Room' and is adorned with sculptures, work and murals by some of the most eminent artists in the history of the British Isles. The room is known for its capacity for exhibition and for its capacity for seating large audiences. Its distinctive architecture is characteristic of which it was designed by Sir Peter Hayn Bay (1898-1977). Inspired by the Tunisian Revolution of 1956, which led to the founding of the Free Frenchmen of that Revolution, and the desire to exhibit works of that era, the LOC opened in 1977 on a philosophy of temporary exhibitions, international exhibitions and cultural support for the Tunisian Artists. Its aim was to display the best of the best contemporary art while supporting independent cultural initiatives in Tunisia, encouraging the setting up of an international platform for art criticism and debate in Tunisia.  Following the establishment of the LOC in 1977, N\u00b0 2 Tunisiense (The Second City of Tunis) was established, naming after the manager of the city\u2019s historic district, N\u00b0 2 Tunisiense. The naming was a response to the LOC\u2019s aim of naming after real people, not fictional characters, fictitious cities were invented to represent real people\u2019s cities, towns and villages in North Africa. For this reason, the LOC was able to showcase the work of artists such as, (...) innovating photography, (...) inventing video art"
