        " Another is the fact that most biennials are shallow affairs, lacking substance and ambition. Biennials, in their turn, feed the existing ferment of mediocrity. The Fourth World Cup demonstrated the fragility of international football in 2014. The next edition, the International League of Miocene Games, will demonstrate the power of cultural evolution in the modern era. The theme Biennale of the Future, Imagined Borders, will showcase the promise of cultural migration. The Biennale of the Future Indus will showcase the will of creative people living in and around the Indus river. Indus Biennale will act as a festival of arts, with regional, communal and global perspectives, to showcase the best contemporary global art of the future.  Indus Biennale Karachi is the flagship project of a multi-disciplinary cultural institution that is committed to the pursuit of excellence in all its forms. Its mission is to bring Pakistan\u2019s leading contemporary artists and curators together to exchange ideas and witness the unfolding drama of global cultural politics in the region. In a region where many cultures live and work, this will be a significant step forward in understanding the social, political and economic issues that shape society.  The establishment of Indus Biennale Karachi was a major cultural event that attracted over 100,000 people, displayed the work of over 400 renowned artists, and was the subject of two acclaimed documentaries. Its installation in the Pakistani cultural landscape was immeasurably more impressive given its intended audience of dignitaries and influential individuals. The venue was built around the idea of the \u2018biennale\u2019, a loose term for a gathering of artists and curators in Pakistan, which is open to all levels of",
        " Another is the indifference of some in authority to the plight of artists, whose art is unwelcome in some cultural spaces and whose art contributes to the depressed state of the artistic traditions.  Last but not least there is the matter of space itself, of space as something extraneous to the narrative of contemporary art. Can contemporary art really exist in a state of continuous growth and development beyond the capacity of most art critics to stomach? Can it survive in a hostile environment where its visibility is limited by the parameters of the exhibition? Can it overcome the mental and physical exhaustion caused by over-work, by-productivity and competition? These are some of the questions that the Tonquin Generation wish to address.  With the support of the Government of India and the Union Ministry of Culture, a dedicated professional group representing art critics from across the country has been set up to jointly monitor and encourage the progress of the Tonquin Generation. In a democratic country, where criticism and debate meet, where individuals are encouraged to express themselves creatively, these are the questions that the Tonquin Generation wish to address.  The first international art events of the Tonquin Generation take place in the capital city, Ahmedabad, India, every three years. Every year, a select group of artists is chosen to represent different regions of India and the world. This event provides a platform for them to engage with their peers and interact socially, politically and critically, in a local, national and international context. In the past, the Tonquin Generation have engaged with artists from different backgrounds and contexts through a range of art projects and exhibitions. These exhibitions have addressed sensitive issues faced by the contemporary community in India and the global context. They have also encouraged participation of young people in the art and cultural life",
        " The Indus Cruise actually started in 1999, as a private voyage by a Japanese artist named Tetsuji Chiba on behalf of his wife who was working in Birmingham. On the invitation of the then Governor General of India, a proposal was made to hold the first edition in Sri Lanka in 2000. Plans were then put in place to bring the Biennial to Bengaluru. Taking into account the criticality of the present, ideas were next re-examined in 2002. The Biennial was finally established as a biennial in 2004. The expanded concept of the Biennial in view of the historical context was then tested in the Indian Ocean coastal town of Goethe Kassel. The fourth edition was held at the end of 2006 in the small village of Daulat Begumpada. The fifth edition was held in the small village of Daulatkala in the middle of the night of November to be followed by a massive open seminar at the local museum. The sixth edition was held in the city of Kolkata in the early hours of December 3, 2007. The opening night featured artists like Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Ratan Tata, Sadhvi Prachi Mitra, Vidyapeeth Jayanti. The majority of the exhibitions were interactive sessions with the artists on loan. After the open seminars and program of art exhibitions, the curators (Benjamin Cook and Defne Ayas with an introduction by Prof. M. Karunanidhi) decided to focus on writing the book. The book was finally published in 2010.  The Biennial is open to all countries and territories of Sri Lanka.  It is organized by the Cultural Foundation of Sri Lanka, a non-",
        " Another is the growing up process, with its  reflections on the state of art and the role of art in society. Skulpture, too, is part of this process. We know little about the individual works until they meet their fate. The city and its inhabitants bear the responsibility for their preservation. Our local museums and galleries have an important role to play in this endeavour. However, our relative privation in comparison to those in other cities cannot but attract our attention. We can therefore deduce from the existing works and on to develop the project with you, the community. We shall endeavour to do so. We shall endeavour to make the tonquin generation the nucleus of our own future art. We shall endeavour to make the tonquin generation a resource in the city of Liverpool. We shall endeavour to instil art into the public realm as fully as we possibly can. We shall endeavour to make the tonquin generation a point of pride for Liverpool. We shall endeavour to create a vibrant educational programme for the community. We shall endeavour to demonstrate to the public the benefits of art and culture. We shall endeavour to make the tonquin generation an inspiration to educate and inspire children. We shall endeavour to show the historic significance of art and culture in Liverpool. We shall endeavour to use the tonquin generation as the nucleus of our own future art. We shall endeavour to achieve all these aims through lectures, exhibitions, conferences, talks, tours and publications. We shall endeavour to make the tonquin generation the most influential citizenry in the city.  The Tonquin Biennale aims to:  \u2013 Introduce new concepts and expressions of art to the local public;  \u2013 Provide a platform for senior curators to experiment with new curatorial approaches;"

Its inaugural iteration, \u201cThe Magnificent Seven,\u201d marked the seventeenth Venice Biennale and was staged at the Venetian Institute in Venice.

The new format will be inspired by the tools of the exhibition to exhibit a twelve-year retrospective of Bonetti\u2019s work, \u2018The Children\u2019s Museum,\u201d which opened at the old Ballon in Rome in 2013, and will take place in the same building as the original exhibition.
