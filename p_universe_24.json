        "Instead, the next Whitney Biennial should serve as a starting point for regeneration, a starting point that sees us back on the right track after so many hard choices have been made off the beaten track. The point is not to celebrate glitz and glamour but to reflect on the humanity of contemporary art and reflect on the fragility of the present moment.  The Whitney Biennial has no position in the world of art nor does it pretend to. It is an event, which, as such, is grounded in a process of constant redefinition and fresh creation. Whitney Biennial is not about the aesthetic experience itself but about the dialogue and the engagement generated by it. Whitney Biennial creates role models and role models speak louder than words. The event is not about the aesthetic quality of the art but about the discourse surrounding it.  The process of creating the Whitney Biennial is ongoing. Past events have discussed labour and class, environmentalism and globalisation, past tense and present tense, crisis and opportunity, past participle and present participle.  The idea of creating a biennial emerged from the need to renew and re-exhibit Liverpool\u2019s vibrant multicultural image. The need to do so was both immediate and acute as the city was under threat of closure and regeneration. The Biennial aims to respond and be creative in its ability to perform, to exhibit and to inhabit the city. It seeks to be a new kind of destination. A new kind of transit. A new kind of meeting. A new kind of social encounter.  The Whitney Biennial is not about the aesthetic quality of the art but about the discourse surrounding it. The event is not about the aesthetic quality of the art but about the discourse surrounding it.",
        "The Next Whitney Biennial was first staged at the Museum of Liverpool in 2008. The exhibition saw Liverpool\u2019s leading figures - Christopher Hitchens, Jonathan Watkins and Richard Wilson in white, framed and mounted on murals -come together to contemplate the challenges of the contemporary artist. It followed a two-year residency at the Museum of Liverpool, during which time artists visited the Liverpool workshop and exhibition rooms, and worked with the artists there, and in 2012 the complex set of circumstances of presenting the exhibition made it possible for all involved.  The Next Whitney Biennial, as such, has been a long time in the making. Since the turn of the millennium, Liverpool\u2019s art scene had become firmly embedded in the cultural landscape of the North of England, and the exhibition had a particularly strong presence in the city. Liverpool\u2019s reputation as a centre for fine art and performance was well-established under its iconoclastic stewardship of JK Rowling, and the festival reflected that in both its concept and in its practice.  However, in the face of increasing marginality, from a field that seemed to constantly be adding to it, and with growing concerns about the state of the art, the festival made its move to the city a reality. The festival embarked on a two-year residency at the Museum of Liverpool, where it presented numerous exhibitions, transformed into permanent exhibitions, and presented a unique and site-specific programme. The move to the city was complemented by a year long creative residency at the Liverpool Art Gallery, which allowed the gallery to re-evaluate its vision for the festival.  The Next Whitney Biennial has since entered a year long process of refinement culminating in the 1st f\u00fcr das Berlin"

Offret is fascinated by people and their everyday behaviours, and by the ways in which these are laid bare in public spaces \u2013 be it at railway crossings or in city centres. She is particularly interested in issues of consent, agency and bodily similarity that are exercised in everyday life, such as at a music festival or on the metro. \n\tFor Whitney Biennial 2016, Renfro has created \n\tTo-day 9th of July 2016 as part of the Monuments from the Future episode.

For the last quarter of a century his practice has had the status of folk hero, largely because of his uncanny ability to translate his incredible technological know-how into visually arresting and coherent works of art. Throughout this work he has attempted to live according to the values of his art \u2013 compassionately employing violence, theft, excess and crude humor \u2013 while also addressing major political issues of the day.

In his recent projects the artist applies the sculptural methodologies of the Romantics and Pleiadian school of artists, and focuses on the societal and political processes generated by technologies that are intimately related to his practice. In his recent projects the artist creates functional sculptures using existing infrastructure, such as abandoned airplanes and skateboards, to generate highly original and imaginative sculptures.\n\tTaylor McNamara (b. 1970, Los Angeles, USA) lives and works in Los Angeles, USA.

His images are based on memoirs and archival footage of imaginary patients arriving at the Christ-Mapes hospital by the name of \u2018Sinta Azzola\u2019. Maas explains that the image presented in the work is that of a dream \u2013 in that it is a vivid and temporary image: \u2018In a dream I was cured\u2019. The Christ-Mapes hospital is actually a rather large and notorious institution.

By bringing people together across economic and racial divides, Cafourek engages in a dialogue that goes beyond theoretical discourse. He has also experimented with new media, video and performance-based modes of expression. \n\tFor Touched, Cafourek unleashed his artistic gestalt in the form of a video installation entitled \n\tTouched. Taking its cue from the autobiographical work of American artist Alphonse Mucha, the work comprises short narratives presented across three spaces: fa\u00e7ade of a former Mexican government building in Harlem, New York, US (2001); an abandoned 1930\u2019s shopping centre in Liverpool,",

In addressing these sensitive and taboo subjects, Raymond Pettibon (b. 1957, Norwood, MA) often stages private, unplanned, events.

The film presents a dialogue of food, power and power in relation to human and technological technology. It is presented within the context of a burgeoning multidisciplinary scientific and technological movement, which challenges the way we conceive of reality through \u00a0 innovative new media. \n\tThe Food Lab can be described as a song and dance number in three ways: it is a video, it is a film and it is a play on",

The workers\u2019 petition read: \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the worsening air quality in Rome, where the factories are located, and in particular about the poor working conditions at such factories. We support all efforts to solve this problem, including the efforts of the government and the global coalition of international organizations, but we recommend against the upcoming event.\u201dThe petition also cited the pollution produced by factories in the area\u0097particularly the Collezione Bicocca, where the factory is located and where the June 6 earthquake and tsunami devastated the region\u0097as one of the reasons for the cancellation.The petition states that the air quality in Rome is worse than in Turin, where the recent earthquake and tsunami occurred, and that the health of the workers and the general public is at risk.

I would be here tomorrow if it hadn\u2019t been for the biennial.\u201d\n\n\nIndiana University, Purdue University Art Museum and Botanical Gardens, and Museum of the American West in Denver have reached a long-term settlement over the future of the old Northland Center, the former home of the Indiana University Art Museum and Botanical Gardens and the Museum of the American West. The agreement between the institutions states that the center will remain closed during the university\u2019s next academic year, but that the renovation and expansion of the former Hofstra campus can continue with the Museum of the American West as a permanent fixture.\u201cIn recognition of the unique historical and contemporary significance of the campus, the Northland Center, and the Museum of the American West, as well as the substantial contributions made by their staff and benefactors, the parties have agreed upon a comprehensive and cooperative future for the Northland Center, the Museum of the American West, and the Northland Museum of Art,\u201d said James Cuno, chair of the Northland board of trustees.\u00a0The Northland Museum of Art opened in 1988, the same year the Museum of the American West\u2019s first exhibition, \u201cTheology of the Mind,\u201d was conceived.

No wonder, then, that we are deeply concerned by this week\u2019s announcement that the next iteration of the London Biennial will be a \u201cmore divided city.\u201d While the pavilion will still focus on themes such as the city\u2019s history, its programming will be markedly different. The event\u2019s executive director, Charlotte Alter, said: \u201cThe impact of the biennial on people\u2019s lives and on the city\u2019s economy is here for all to see. And now it\u2019s our turn to be a part of it. We must take our role as London\u2019s city-states seriously and not just talk about it. We must act. . . .
